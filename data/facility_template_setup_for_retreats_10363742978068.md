# Facility Template Setup for Retreats
Facility Templates are used to manage facilities for the Retreat / Conference module and also lodging for sessions. These templates are re-usable from season to season and event to event to make scheduling and reservations faster and easier. Before you can create a facility template, you will first need to create Facility Categories.


 


## Finding Facility Categories


All facilities must be assigned to a category. Categories help organize your facilities as well as in your reporting on the facilities themselves.    


**To create or edit a Facility Category:**


1. 1. Go to the Settings menu.
	2. Expand the Facility Templates.
	3. Select [Facility Categories.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/FacilityCategoriesList.aspx)


 


## Creating a New Facility Category


1. 1. Click the **Create a New Facility Category.**
	2. Enter a **Category Name.** This can be anything from "Cabins" to "Meals" to "Eagle Lodge." Keep in mind that this is a heading and not the actual facility an individual or group will be assigned to.
	3. **Category Description** is optional and does not appear to the public.
	4. Select an **allocation account** *(optional)*using the dropdown menu. Once an allocation account is selected, all revenue gained from this facility category will apply to the specified account (unless overridden on the facility itself).
	5. Use the **Category Type** menu to indicate whether this is a "Facility," "Lodging," or "Meal" type facility. This feature is particularly useful when using the Retreat Center.
	6. By default, the Active box is checked. Uncheck this box only if you wish to deactivate the facility category.
	7. Use the **Save Category** button to save your category and any changes you have made.


 


## Editing an Existing Category


Existing Facility Categories will be listed alphabetically along with their description, Allocation Account number, and Facility Type. 


* To edit a facility category by clicking the **pencil or edit icon** to the right.
* Click the **X or delete** icon to disable the facility category.

## Finding Facility Templates


Facility Templates are the actual groups, activities, and/or items to which individuals are assigned. This can be done either through when making a retreat reservation (or through Lodging Assignments for sessions).    


**To create or edit Facility Templates:** 


1. 1. Go to the Settings menu.
	2. Expand the Facility Templates.
	3. Click the [Facility Templates link.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/FacilitiesList.aspx)


 


## Creating a New Facility or Editing an Existing One


To create a new facility, click the button at the top of the page. If you are editing an existing facility, click on it or the edit icon to the right. You can then address the following settings:


1. 1. The **Facility Name** will be visible to the public in retreat reservation correspondence and in your reports. (It also shows to the public during session registration if they are prompted to select their own lodging.)
	2. You must select a **Facility Category** from the dropdown menu.
	3. **Facility Description** *(optional)* shows to clients who are permitted to select their own lodging in the registration process.
	4. The **Capacity** indicates the default number of individuals who can occupy or use this facility at a given time. This field is required but can be overridden elsewhere.
	5. **Allocation account** *(optional)*Select using the dropdown menu. Once an allocation account is selected, all revenue gained from this facility will apply to the specified account. If set here, the allocation account will override allocation account selections on the Facility Category and/or Session level.
	6. Check the **Active box**to set this facility for active use on retreat reservations (or sessions).


While this is all that is necessary for creating facilities used with sessions, for Retreat Module setup you'll need to address the next section as well.


#### Retreat / Conference Center Reservation Defaults:


The retreat defaults will impact how your facility behaves when added to a retreat reservation. All these settings are *optional,* but the Price Definitions are necessary if you wish to bill for this item.


1. 1. Check the box for **Occurs Daily** if this facility is booked for a specific, recurring time throughout the retreat reservation. This works particularly well for things like meals or daily instructors.
	2. If you checked the box for "Occurs Daily," Enter the daily **Start Time** and **End Time** to indicate when this item is available/occurring.
	3. Text entered in the **Operating Hours** field will show to admins when reviewing this facility template.
	4. Check the box if you want to **Add total reservation participants as default quantity** when reserving this item. This is useful if participants count toward this facility's capacity or if you charge per person.
	5. Check the **Price Definitions** that should apply to this facility. The selected price definitions can be selected when creating a retreat reservation.
	6. Click **Save Facility** button to upload your changes to the database.
