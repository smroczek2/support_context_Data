# Understanding Fees and Payments on an Account
The Fees and Payments section displays an overview of financial activity for a designated season. 


* It is broken into several subsections displaying Reservation Fees, Other Fees, Payments / Credits, and any Balance Forward.
* Details for each of these sections can be reviewed through expandable menus and View icons.
* By default, the Fees and Payments menu on the Finance Detail page displays a summary of finances for the current season.
	+ This can be adjusted by using the dropdown menu to select an individual season, past or present.
	+ By selecting **Entire History** from the dropdown menu, you can view the entire financial history of this account.


## 
Time Focus or Session Focus


You can adjust how the financial information is displayed by changing the **Display as** dropdown menu to show either a **Timeline Focus** or a **Session Focus**.


* The Timeline Focus arranges the Fees and Payments based on when the action was initiated.
* Choosing to display as a Session Focus will show transactions related to reservations and their associated fees in the selected season.


## 
Reservation Fees


Reservation Fees display with their date and a summary amount. 


* To view more details, you can expand the Reservation Fees by clicking the session name or the + icon to the left.
* Clicking the **Binoculars or View icon** to the right will redirect you to the Reservation Detail page.


  
In addition to the view icons, a small square icon offers financial information on each reservation fee.


* If the square has a green checkmark, these fees are paid in full. Otherwise, these fees are not paid off.
* Hovering over the box will give you the value of the balance.
* Clicking on the square will bring up a popup with the ledger entries related to this fee.
* The box icon will be replaced with a warning triangle if the fees owed are past due.


## 
Other Fees


The Other Fees section displays additional, non-reservation fees such as seasonal fees, product orders, store and email fees, debits, etc.


* Depending on the type of fee, these transactions can be viewed in greater detail using the view icon to the right and edited or deleted.
* Certain types of additional fees only have a delete option and cannot be edited.


## Payments / Credits


Payments and credits are displayed with the **Binoculars or View icon**  to the right.


* Clicking this icon will redirect you to a Payment Detail page where you can edit, refund, and occasionally void or delete the transaction (depending on the transaction type).
* The Payment Detail page also allows you to reallocate transaction funds to the various fees incurred on the account.


## 
Scheduled / Anticipated Payments


If there are scheduled or anticipated payments, the Scheduled / Anticipated Payments menu will appear. 


* You can view and delete scheduled or anticipated payments here.
	+ **Scheduled Payments** are electronic payments and will be collected automatically
	+ **Anticipated Payments** are displayed when a client promises to pay by Mail-in Payment at the end of registration. These must be recorded manually when you receive them.
* Failed Scheduled Payments will be listed with a **red alert icon**.
