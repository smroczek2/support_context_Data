# Retreat Communication
UltraCamp offers a number of tools to help with your communication with retreat and rental groups.


 


## Confirmation Options


When a retreat reservation is created, you can access several Confirmation options to send or print estimates, confirmations, and invoices. Each will include a list of all currently selected facilities and pricing, discounts, and deposits. 


* Select the **Email** link to open UltraCamp's email tool with the estimate, invoice, or confirmation pre-selected
* Select the **Print** link to generate a pdf of the estimate, invoice, or confimation

 Tip


To make the most of the email tool, we recommend setting up **Email Templates** to pull in your default messaging quickly and easily. You can learn how to [create Email Templates here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/9973916676372)



 


You can customize aspects of the language and appearance of the **Invoice** and **Confirmation** pdf by taking the following steps:


1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the "System / Management" section
2. Click [Retreat / Conference Settings](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Wizards/RetreatSetup/Default.aspx)
3. In the wizard, expand the **Settings** section and click [Confirmation Settings](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/RetreatSetup/confirmationsettings.aspx)
4. Update the desired settings
5. Click the **Complete** button to save your changes


The resulting pdf output will resemble the sample below:





 


## Quick Buttons


In addition to UltraCamp's default communication links, you can create custom Quick Buttons that automatically retrieve a custom Email Template and automatically attach any documents you have uploaded, including custom invoices.


 


To set up a quick button, you'll first need to create a customized Email Template. You can learn how to [create Email Templates here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/9973916676372). Once this is done, you can take the following steps to add or edit a Quick Button to your Retreat Reservation page:


1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the "Communication" section.
2. Click ['Quick Buttons'.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/correspondenceButtonsList.aspx)
3. Click "Create a New Correspondence Button" or the edit link next to an existing correspondence button in the list.
4. Enter the **Button Name**. This will appear below your button wherever it is displayed.
5. Select your **Email Template** from the dropdown.
6. Choose the page where you want your button to appear. For retreat communication, choose the **Retreat Reservation Detail**.
7. Click the button to **Save** your changes.


You should now be able to find your new Quick Button under the Correspondence section on the Retreat Reservation Detail page.
