# Creating and Managing Group Preorder Templates
Group Preorder Templates control a leader's experience when they reserve a number of spaces in a session. What information leaders must provide, how many spaces they can reserve, and whether or not they must pay a deposit are all dictated by the template. Of course, a template must be connected to a session in order for its settings to affect registration.

1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the **Session Templates** section.
2. Click [Group Preorder Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/groupPreorderTemplateList.aspx).

## Group Preorder Template Settings and Details.


Group Preorder Templates have a number of settings that dictate registration behavior. The details of these settings are listed below:


* + The Preorder Template **Name** is used for admin setup purposes and reference only. It is not visible to the public.
	+ If you are wish the group leader to pay a deposit for the spaces they reserve, use the **Deposit Required** settings to specify how that amount is calculated.
		- Enter the amount in the data field and indicate whether it is a **Dollar** or **Percent** amount
		- If you select "Dollar" as the deposit type, you can check the box to make this **Deposit per person.**
	+ A **Minimum Reservation Size** prevents the leader from reserving less than this number of spaces.

	+ If you want to let leaders return later and adjust the number of spaces they have reserved, check the box to **Enable Public Edit**.
	+ By default, a Group Preorder Template is **Enabled**. If you wish to have this template no longer visible for selection on sessions, you can uncheck this box.
