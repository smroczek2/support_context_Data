# Scheduling A New Session
Sessions are scheduled from an existing Session Template. Default information, as well as Fixed Settings, are added automatically when you create the new session.


To add a new session, you can use any of the following locations to get started:


* On the [Home Page](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/default.aspx) you can select the Schedule a New Session button.
* On the [Summary of Sessions](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/scheduling/sessions.aspx) page, select the Add a new session link at the top of the page.
* Using the My Sessions dropdown menu, select the Schedule a new Session link.


Each of these will take you into the [Schedule a New Session](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/wizards/newSession/selectMaster.aspx) wizard.

## Basic Information Page


On the Basic Information page, you will need to enter appropriate data into at least the required fields—you can ignore any fields that don’t apply.


  



### 


### Basic Information Fields


**Session Name**


* Adjust the Session Name from the Template Name if appropriate.
* This is a required field.


**Sub Categories**


* These create a visual division of sessions whenever they are listed together on UltraCamp.
* Sessions with the same Sub Category name will be grouped together with the Sub Category as the header.
* **Sub Category 2** displays within **Sub Category 1**.


**Location**


* Assign a Location from the dropdown menu.


**Session Code** 


* If your organization uses Session Codes, you can enter this session’s code here.


**Begin Date/End Date** 


* These will indicate when your program or event starts and finishes.
* These are required


**Alternate Date Label**


* Date range for events is displayed in a mm/dd/yyyy – mm/dd/yyyy format (e.g. 6/14/2020 – 6/19/2020).
* You can replace this with an **Alternate Date Label** of your choice.


**Daily Start and Daily End time**


* If this session repeats daily during the Begin and End Dates, it can be set with a Daily Start and Daily End Time.
* This is particularly useful for daily repeating courses.
* UltraCamp will display a Daily Start and End time if entered.


**Time Description**


* This replaces the Daily Start and End Time with whatever text you enter in this field.


**Registration Begin Date**


* This determines when clients can go online and register for this session.


**Registration End Date**


* Determines when public registration by clients is disabled.


**Modification Cutoff Date**


* Determines when a client can no longer modify options and activities selected along with this session.
* You and your staff can modify a reservation at any time.
* The Modification Cutoff Date defaults to the Registration End Date if you leave this field blank.


**Cancellation Cutoff Date**


* Determines when a client can no longer cancel their own reservation.
* You and your staff can cancel a reservation at any time.
* The Cancellation Cutoff Date defaults to the Registration End Date if you leave this field blank.


**Paid-in-Full Due Date**


* When this date arrives, clients will be required to pay for the entire session in order to register, regardless of the Payment Option.
* Depending on the Session Template settings, it can also trigger balance due reminder emails.
* The Paid-in-Full Due Date defaults to the Session Begin Date if you leave this field blank.


**Complete Button:** 


* Once you’ve entered the appropriate data, click the Complete button to save your information and proceed to the next page of the wizard.

### Next Step


On this page you will be offered three options:


1. 1. Selecting **Schedule another session** will take you back to the Session Master page to repeat the process.
	2. Choosing to **Continue working with this session in the Session Editing Wizard** will allow you to use the Session Editing wizard to adjust the default settings for this specific session.
	3. Electing to **Copy settings to this session from a previously scheduled session** will take you to the Copy Settings wizard where you can copy some specific settings from another previously scheduled session.


 


## Editing Capacity
