# Dispensing and Administering Medication
 The administration of medication can be logged in UltraCamp on an individual level. This is helpful when dealing with one person specifically, rather than a number of individuals at once.    


To log the administration or dispensing of medications for an individual, there are two ways to log information for an individual:


1. 1. **In the Health menu:**
		1. Expand the Recording section.
		2. Select Record Dispensed Medications.
		3. On the resulting page, type the account number or part of the name in the Select the Account field.
		4. Once you've identified the correct account, Select the person for whom you wish to dispense medications from the dropdown menu.
		5. Click the Next button.
	2. **Open the appropriate account:**
		1. Click on the desired individual under Account Members.
		2. Expand the Medications menu on the Person Detail page.
		3. Click the Administer Meds link.

UltraCamp will record the time of the log entry but indicate the alternate dispense time as well.
* **Reason/Comments:** Comments can be recorded in the Reason/Comments field.
* **Save Record:**When finished, click the Save Record to complete the log entry.
