## Restricting a Session by Age


* Age Based Sessions have a minimum and maximum age limit.
* Limits are set on the master but can be amended on a session by session basis.
* UltraCamp will display these age limits on the public side, and only eligible individuals will be able to register for age-restricted programs.
* Eligibility is normally determined based on the age of the registrant on the session Start Date, however the calculation can be adjusted for any given session.
* A grace period can also be set (in months) to allow people to register who do not fit exactly the displayed restrictions.


 


## Restricting a Session by Grade


* A session can be restricted by age or grade depending on the Session Master template settings.
* Grade based sessions check for eligibility based on the attendee’s grade at the start of the session—not necessarily the current grade on the account.
* Grade restrictions can be set to any grade from Pre-K through College.
* An additional grade setting is “Not in School” which can indicate anyone outside the Pre-K to College parameters.


 


## Overriding Age and Grade Restrictions for Adult Registrants


* For events where age or grade is restricted but adults can attend, you can check the box to allow anyone designated as an adult to register for this session.



#### 
 Note


Unlike the other settings on the Age Restrictions page, this is a fixed setting for all sessions scheduled from this template.
