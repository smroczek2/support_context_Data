# Task Templates
## How Task Templates Work


* Task Templates are used to track events which are not part of the registration process.
* They can be manually added or automatically added by the completion of a reservation.
* Once added to an account, they can trigger reminder emails, be manually marked complete, or be automatically marked complete by the submission of a document.



#### 
 Note


The due date of a task can trigger a Task Reminder Email. This email can be a custom message or you can use UltraCamp's default Task Reminder Email. Below you will find the text for the default reminder email.
