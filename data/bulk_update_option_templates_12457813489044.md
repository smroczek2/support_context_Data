# Bulk Update Option Templates
The Bulk Updates Tool can be used to update option templates. Bulk updating Fixed Settings on a template will of course affect the Fixed Settings of upcoming scheduled options. 


To locate the Bulk Updates tool, take the following steps:


1. Go to the **Tools menu** and expand **Additional Tools.**
2. Click [Bulk Updates.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/bulkUpdates/updateType.aspx)


## Updating Scheduled Session Options


In order to update Option Templates, you will need to indicate which Options you'd like your changes to apply to, which aspects to update, and what the new settings should be. Finally, you will confirm your changes and process the bulk update.


Here are the steps:


1. 1. In the **Bulk Updates** tool, select [Option Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/bulkUpdates/bulkUpdate_optionMasters.aspx).
	2. On the Filters page, indicate which Option Templates you wish to adjust and click **Select**.
		* You can use the *Change Filters* link at the top to change which Templates are displayed for selection.
	3. Check the box to the left of any setting you wish to update.
	4. Enter your new values to the right of the indicated setting.
	5. Click the **Next** button.
	6. On the summary page, review your changes and click **Process Bulk Update.**
	7. Confirm your change as prompted.


These changes will affect the Option Templates you selected. Changes to *Flexible Settings* will not impact any options already scheduled from these templates.


Any adjustments to *Fixed Settings* will affect all instances of options scheduled from these templates.


A more detailed breakdown of the pages and terms is listed below the video.
