# Make a Sponsorship Payment
## Sponsorship Payment


Sponsorship payments make a claim against the account of sponsor by way of a Sponsorship Code. This creates a credit on the claiming account and a linked, corresponding debit on the sponsor account. Sponsorship payments can be made from both the Admin and Public side.
