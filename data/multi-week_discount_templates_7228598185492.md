#### 
 Note


In order for a Multi-week Discount to trigger and add automatically to reservations, it must be scheduled for those sessions. You can learn about how to [connect a Multi-week Discount to sessions here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7228503425940#adding-a-multiweek-discount-0-0).




#### 
 Note


Multi-week Discounts work only with Individual-based sessions. They do not work with Group-based reservations.  To reduce pricing by the number of participants in a Group-based reservation, you'll need to use a Group Pricing Structure.

## Multiweek Discount Terms and Settings


Below is a detailed description of each of the settings on Multiweek Discount Templates:


### Basic Information Setting Details


* The **Discount Name** will appear to the client in several places, including the cart and reservation detail.
* This template can be set to be percentage- or a dollar amount-based.  A **Default Amount** must be entered, but the exact numbers can be adjusted on a session by session basis.  The type of discount (dollar or percentage) cannot be tailored per session.
* You may enter a **Description** in the field provided.  This description will show on the Discounts page in the registration process.
* You may wish to uncheck the box to **Display this discount to the public in the registration process** if you don't have other discounts displaying. This will hide the discount in the registration process, although it will still appear in the shopping cart and confirmation.
* You may also uncheck the box to **Display this discount on the session information page**.


### Automatic Approval Setting Details


* Designate how many reservations it takes to trigger this discount using the **Required Reservations**
* To make this discount a sibling or multi-person discount, check the **Applied Across Account** box and indicate how many different individuals it takes to trigger this discount in the field to the right.
* You can put a maximum discount **Limit** on the template that is a per person limit or per account limit.  This will prevent an individual or account from receiving a greater discounted amount than you specified in the field.
* This discount can **Apply to** a reservation in two different ways.  You can either set it so that **all reservations that meet the above criteria** receive the discount, or you can stipulate that only certain reservations receive the discount.  Individuals or reservations can be prioritized based on **Order Date, Session Begin Date, Session Order Total,** or **Person Order Total**.
