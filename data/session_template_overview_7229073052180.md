# Session Template Overview
Session Templates in UltraCamp function as starting points for all sessions you will schedule from season to season. Our favorite analogy is a stencil. It has an outline and a shape, but no details. Use the template as an outline, then fill in your details in the Session Editing Wizard. Your session comes to life when you schedule it.
