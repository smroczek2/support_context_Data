## Report Parameters


* **Balance Type:** The Balance Type filter focuses the report on one of the following settings:
	+ **Balance Due Accounts** are accounts which owe money to your organization.
	+ **Credit Due Accounts** are accounts that have a credit owed them.
	+ **Non '0' Balances** are all accounts where the balance is not zero--this includes Balance Due Accounts and Credit Due Accounts.
	+ **'0' Balances** are accounts with no credit or balance.
	+ **All Accounts** shows every account in your database along with its balance.
* **As Of:**By default, the Account Balances report shows current information. By entering a date and/or time in the As of: (optional) field, you can report on account balances at a specific date and time in the past.
* **With Reservations Beginning:**Use the With Reservations Beginning (optional) filter to look for accounts that also have reservations during the time-frame you specify.
	+ Note: This filter does NOT identify whether their reservation has a balance. It just verifies that account has a reservation in the specified time and fulfills the other selected Report Parameters.


**Search:** Click the Search button to run a report based on a combination of the parameters above.
