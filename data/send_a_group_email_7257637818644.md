# Send a Group Email 
## Mass Email


A single email can be sent to a designated group of individuals through UltraCamp. This email can be personalized to each recipient if desired and contain attachments as well as links. Marketing emails can be designated as such and automatically attach an unsubscribe link which will prevent those who click the link from receiving further marketing emails without adversely affecting normal fee and reservation communication.    


1. Go to the **Tools** menu and expand **Correspondence** menu.
2. Click the link to **[Email a Stored Group.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Correspondence/email.aspx)**
3. On the resulting page, choose the "Email a stored group" option to proceed.



  
  



## Select a Stored Group


1. 1. Click on the dropdown menu.
	2. Select the stored group to whom you would like to send an email.
		* To enable emailing of a stored group, it must contain one of the following columns: idAccount, idPerson, or email.
	3. Click the Next button to proceed.

## Send Information


* **Subject field:** Enter the subject line for the email. This is a required field.
* **From field:**Using the From field, you may select any email address from your list of users or the general camp email address as the email of origin.
* **CC field:** If an email address is entered in the CC field, that email address will receive a copy of the email as well. By default, will CC only the first email in the group and not send a copy of every email in the stored group. However, you can override this by unchecking the appropriate box.



#### 
 Tip


You can enter multiple addresses in the CC line if you separate them with a comma.



 


* **To:**The stored group you selected will be displayed in the To: line. You can also indicate whether you wish the email should be sent to the Primary Contact , the Individual identified in the stored group by idPerson (often the attendee), or Both if they are identified with different email addresses on the account.
	+ **Inactive Accounts** are not sent mass emails by default. However, you can override this setting by unchecking the designated box.


## 
When should the email be sent?


* **Send Date:** This determines when a queued email will actually begin to transmit. If this field is left blank, the queued email will begin to transmit 15 minutes from when you press the Send button. You can set the Send Date to any other time using the calendar and time pickers.
* **Emergency:**An email can be designated as an emergency email by checking the Emergency box. This bypasses other email processes and queues the message for immediate delivery. This option should only be used for emergency situations.


If you are not using the advanced email tool, click the **Next**button to proceed.


## 
Is this a Marketing Email?


Federal law requires that all emails sent for the purpose of marketing include an opt out provision. On all mass emails, you must indicate whether or not this is a marketing email.



#### 
 Tip


What counts as a marketing email? Any correspondence concerning an upcoming, existing reservation or information regarding account balances is NOT considered marketing. Everything else is probably marketing.



* **Marketing Allotment:** If you are using UltraCamp's email servers to send on your behalf, you'll receive a free monthly allotment of marketing emails. Going over this allotment will result in a charge per recipient as indicated in your contract. UltraCamp displays the remaining marketing emails for the month next to the **Yes, this is a marketing email**answer option.
* **Regular email:** If you are using an email sending scheme, UltraCamp will be mailing directly from your email server and no fees will be assessed from UltraCamp. Please contact your provider for information on email limits and fees.


If you are not using the advanced email tool, click the **Next**button to proceed.


## 
Email Templates


* **Save as New Template:** Email messages can be saved as templates for repeated use using the Save as a new template link. This will bring up a popup window where you can name the template and indicate whether you wish to save its attachments as well. Use the Save Template button to store your template in the database.
* **Load an Email Template:**Once a template has been saved it can be edited by selecting it from the Load an Email Template dropdown menu. You can change the content of the template and use the Save link to save your changes. Use the Delete link to remove the template from the database permanently.


## 
Email Content


The creation of the email message takes place in the **Email Content** section. At the top of this section are Formatting Tools which can be used to help compose your message or even paste it in from an external source. The function of each button can be seen by holding your mouse over it. Below the buttons is a row of dropdown menus for indicating Font Name and Size.


* **Links to UltraCamp:** In addition to these formatting options, you can also add Links to UltraCamp to the email. To do this, place your cursor in the composition area below where you want the link to show then select the desired link from the dropdown menu.
* **Personalization Fields:** These can be used to tailor the message to individual recipient. Selecting a field from the dropdown menu will place code at your cursor in the composition area. When the email is queued, UltraCamp will replace this code with information from the account or stored group. For example, selecting the personalization "primary\_nameFirst" would insert the first name of the primary contact into the recipient's email.
* **Insert Content Here:** The message itself is written over the text "Insert content here" below your logo and contact information.
* **Display of Message:** At the bottom of the composition area, you can adjust the display of the message from the Design view (the default view) to the HTML view where you can interact with the html directly or to a Preview mode which hides the design markings and isn't editable but offers a look at the email appearance.


## 
Attachments


Files can be attached to the email from the library of **Documents** uploaded via the Settings menu, financial Statements, or you can select a file from your computer using the **Choose File** button.


## 
Previewing and Sending


You can use the **Preview** button to have UltraCamp generate the email for review. This will also display a summary section where you can edit some of the basic message settings if necessary. Click the View link to look at the email itself.


* **Send Email:** Click the Send Email button to queue mass email for delivery.



#### 
 Tip


Once you've queued the email, you may review it using the **Account Correspondence icon** in the Current Account menu or by using the Email Correspondence report in the Reports menu. If the email is still in the queue, it can even be deleted to prevent it from sending.
