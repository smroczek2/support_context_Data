# Tasks and Processes 
Tasks and Processes are a great way to manage items that you or a customer needs to complete. Tasks are like items on a checklist, and the process is like a checklist containing those tasks.

## Tasks


If there are items you or your customers need to complete prior to their arrival, you can accomplish this with tasks. Examples of common tasks would be: Upload Immunization records, Schedule Interview, Upload signed Staff Contract. Upload insurance cards, etc.



#### 
 Note


Keep in mind that online forms already have a built in tracking and completion monitoring, so tasks would not be used for those. Use tasks for everything except online forms.



 


## To create a Task Template:


1. 1. Click on **Settings** and expand **System Management**.
	2. Click on Task Template.
	3. Select Create New Task Template.
	4. Set up your task settings and Save.


**Automated reminder emails**


* Each task can have have up to three automated reminder emails.
* These emails would be sent out on a schedule you determine.
* Only those who have not completed the task would get the reminder email.


 


## Processes


You can create a number of tasks and put them in a process. The process can then be attached to a session, so the associated tasks are automatically assigned when someone registers for that session.


**To create a Process:**


1. 1. Click on Settings and expand System Management.
	2. Choose Processes.
	3. Select Create New Process and name the Process and Save.
	4. Click Add a new task.
	5. Select a task from the drop down menu.
	6. Assign step in process.
	7. Assign due date and **Save**.


**Assigning a process to a session:**


1. 1. Open the session Editing Wizard for the desired session.
	2. Select **My Sessions** and click on the **edit icon** next to the appropriate session.
	3. Expand the **Advanced Settings** tab.
	4. Check the box next to the processes or processes you want attached to the session.
	5. Click **Complete.**


**Adding a process to a stored group:**


1. 1. Create a stored group of individuals using a report such as the roster report.
	2. Then go to the **Tools** menu and click on the **Management Section**.
	3. Click on **Add Process to Stored Group**.
	4. Select the stored group that you created and click the **Next** button.
	5. Select the **Process** and click **Next**.
	6. Confirm the due dates (or leave the dates blank to use the default dates that are already in the process).
	7. Click A**dd Process**.


## 
Completed Tasks


If a task is set up to require a document upload, the public user can complete the task by uploading the appropriate document. The public user must go to the document center and follow the instructions for the associated document.


* To set up a task for a document to be uploaded, a placeholder document must be placed in the document center. Usually this is a PDF that contains the steps for the public user to follow to make sure their document is uploaded correctly.
* The document must have the same name as the document to be uploaded. For example, if an immunization record should be uploaded, the document center document would be named “Immunization Record Upload” (or something similar).
* The document must be set to allow public upload.


## 
Creating a Placeholder Document


**To upload a placeholder document:**


1. 1. Go to **Settings** and select **Communication**.
	2. Click on **Document Management**.
	3. Upload a New Document and fill in Document Name.
	4. Select Category or create a new one.
	5. Upload File: choose file to attach.
		* Keep in mind this is a placeholder document; clients will be clicking the upload button next to the document, not on the document itself.
		* File must be available in the Document Center and enabled.



#### 
 Tip


Create a file with directions for uploading and use that as the placeholder document.



1. 6. Document Processing Type: select Per Person.
	7. Processing Receipt Type to Public: choose receipt type, if any, the public should receive upon upload.
	8. Display Processed Documents to Public: uncheck the box next to if you do not want the public to see the document they upload after it has been processed.
		* Uploaded documents would appear with other online forms on their person/account detail page.
	9. Staff to Notify on Receipt: select who should be notified, if any, when a document is uploaded.
	10. Processed Document Completes Task: select the task that this uploaded document completes.
	11. Form Fill Binding: is not necessary here.
	12. Expiration Type: choose the desired expiration settings for this document.
	13. Allow Public Upload: check box to  "allow public upload".
	14. Save Document.


## Testing a Public Side Document Upload


1. 1. Once set, you can try uploading a document from a test account on the public side.
	2. Once the document is uploaded, go back to the admin home page.
	3. Under My Info, expand Unprocessed Forms. A new uploaded document will appear here.
	4. Click on the most recent item and follow the prompts to process the item.
	5. When this is finished, the document is processed and will therefore complete that task for the individual that uploaded the document.
