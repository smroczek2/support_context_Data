# Copy Session Settings
The Copy Session Settings wizard can be used to copy specific settings from one existing session to another existing session. This can speed your setup process in situations where multiple sessions share settings in common. Any past or current session can have settings copied to an upcoming session.


**To find the Copy Session Settings tool:**


1. 1. Go to the **Tools** menu and expand the **Additional Tools** section.
	2. Click [Copy Session Settings](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Wizards/CopySessionSettings/Default.aspx).


 


## Using the Copy Session Settings Wizard


The Copy Session Settings tool is a wizard that guides you through the copy process. Follow these steps to copy a session's settings to another session:


1. Depending on your settings, you may need to click **Begin** to start the wizard.
2. **Select a Source Session** using the drop-down menus.
	* The **Select Session** drop-down menu displays which sessions you can choose from.
	* You can adjust which sessions are available by using the Filter drop-down menus.
	* UltraCamp defaults the **Filter Year** to the current year, but you can select any year with scheduled sessions.
3. Select one or more **Destination Sessions** by checking the box to the left of each session.
4. Indicate which **Items to Copy** by checking the appropriate boxes.
	* A zero next to an item indicates that nothing has been scheduled for that setting
5. Click the **Complete**button to process the copy.


You can now exit the wizard or repeat Steps 2 through 5 to copy settings from a different session.


 



Note:


Copying Session Settings is an additive action and will not delete existing settings on the Destination such as discounts and options. However, the tool can overwrite existing aspects during the copy process such as fees and dates.
