# Make a Reservation
## Creating a New Reservation as an Administrator


Making a reservation on the administrative side has several benefits and features that are not available to the public. 


* Pages in the Registration process can be skipped.
* Hidden discounts and options can be added.
* Registration requirements can be overridden and payment can even be bypassed.


Since every registration process is different, this help page will focus on the main highlights of the process as well as the special options available to administrators.
