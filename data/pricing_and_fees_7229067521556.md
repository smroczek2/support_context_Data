## Group Pricing


For Group/Family based Templates and reservations, fees tend to be more complicated than Individual-based sessions. 


**Non-refundable fees are not designed to work with Group/Family sessions and should be avoided.**


If a **Basic Fee**is entered, it will be charged per person on the Family Registration.


* Special pricing structures can be created to accommodate age or group size-based pricing as an alternative.
* Group pricing structures are created in the **Settings menu** and attached on a session/event basis.


If a **non-refundable fee** for a Group-based session needs to implemented:


* Use the **Collect Another Amount feature** to collect a deposit and adjust the **Modification cutoff date**to prevent clients from cancelling their own reservations.
* You and your staff may add in a non-refundable fee at the point of cancellation should that become necessary.


 


## Individual Pricing


* For an Individual based Template and session, Total Fees are derived from the sum of the Non-refundable Fee and the Cost/Basic Fee.
* The Non-refundable Fee can work like a deposit and is kept as a fee when a client cancels a reservation on their own.
* All of the Cost/Basic Fee will be removed from a client’s statement if they cancel on their own.


 


## Alternate Fee Labels


In the registration process, the Non-refundable Fee and Basic Fee will display as these terms. 


* Using the **Alternate Non-refundable Fee Label** and the **Alternate Basic Fee Label**, however, you can replace the default terms with language of your own.
	+ These are fixed settings and will therefore affect all sessions/events created using this Session Template.
* The **Alternate Price Description** can be used to set text to display rather than the Total Fees as part of the selection and registration processes.


 


## Collection Method


The Collection Method determines how much a client must pay before completing their reservation. 


* The method of collection is a fixed setting, but the actual numerical amount is flexible and can vary based on your fees.


**Collection Methods are as follows:**


* **Collect all fees when the reservation is made**requires your clients to pay all fees at checkout in order to complete their registration.
* **Require only the deposit**collects the Non-refundable Fee as a minimum but also allows clients to pay more than the minimum—up to and including the full amount.
* **Payment in Full or Payment Plan** requires that the client pay for everything at checkout or sign up for a Payment Plan. Payment Plans are created elsewhere and added on a per session/event basis.
* **Must Select a Payment Plan** requires the client to choose a payment plan in order to complete their order. Payment Plans are created elsewhere and added on a per session/event basis.


 


## Balance Forward Requirements


You can require that balance forwards be paid using the drop-down menu in the Session Templates wizard.


* Requiring that **balance forwards** from previous seasons be paid at registration for a new season’s session is a good way to prevent returning attendees from building up large amounts of outstanding debt from year to year.
* Selecting **Collect any overdue balances** will require payment for even current season reservations to be paid before selecting a new one.


 


## Allocation Account


An Allocation Account can be set in the Session Template as a default for all sessions scheduled from this template.


* Scheduled sessions can have their allocation account changed on a case-by-case basis.
* To set an Allocation Account, select it from the dropdown menu.


Allocation Accounts are created in the **Settings menu > Accounting >**[**Custom Allocation Accounts**](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/AllocationAccounts.aspx?return=AllocationAccountsList.aspx?confirm=true).


* They can be connected to sessions either in the Session Templates wizard or in the Session Editing wizard.


 


## Paid in Full Reminders


UltraCamp can generate Paid in Full reminder emails automatically from an email template in the system. 


* Up to 3 reminders can be scheduled.
* These emails will trigger based on the specified Paid in Full Due Date (which is set up on a per session basis in the scheduling process).
* You can set how many days before that specified date these messages will send.
* UltraCamp uses a default reminder email template (which is personalized to each individual record), but you can replace this with a template of your own design.
