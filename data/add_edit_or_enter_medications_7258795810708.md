# Add, Edit, or Enter Medications
In order for medication information to be tracked in the system, it must first be added. Often, this is done during the registration process. Outside the registration process, medications can still be added or edited via the Person Detail page.    


**To add or edit medications:**


1. 1. Open the desired account.
	2. On the Account Detail page, click on the appropriate individual's name under Account Members.
	3. In the Medications menu on the right, click the **View / Edit** link.

## How a Client Enters Medications


It can be helpful to see what a client sees when entering medication. Here we will review the function and layout of the public page for adding and editing medication. Most clients will add medications as part of their initial registration process.


To see the medications page from the public point of view, you also may make a reservation, but there is a short cut to the Medications page itself. 


**Use the following steps to go directly to the Medications page:**


1. 1. Access an account (like the Test account).
	2. Click the Public View icon in the upper right. This will take you to the public side.
	3. Click on an account member's name. This will take you to the Person Detail.
	4. Use the **Manage Medications** button under Common Tasks OR in the expandable menus on the right, locate the **Medications menu** and expand it.
	5. Click the **Manage Medications** link to be redirected to the appropriate page.


Clients can also follow these steps to add or edit medications outside the registration process.
