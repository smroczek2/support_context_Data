## Report Parameters Defined


The **Balance Type** filter focuses the report on one of the following settings:


* **Balance Due Accounts** are accounts which owe money to your organization
* **Credit Due Accounts** are accounts that have a credit owed them
* **Non '0' Balances** are all accounts where the balance is not zero--this includes Balance Due Accounts and Credit Due Accounts.
* **'0' Balances**are accounts with no credit or balance.
* **All Accounts** shows every account in your database along with its balance.


 


By default, the Account Balances report shows current information. 


* **As of:** By entering a date and/or time in the As of: (optional) field, you can report on account balances at a specific date and time in the past.
* Use the With **Reservations Beginning:** (optional) filter to look for accounts that also have reservations during the time-frame you specify.



#### 
 Note


This filter does NOT identify whether their reservation has a balance. It just verifies that account has a reservation in the specified time and fulfills the other selected Report Parameters.
