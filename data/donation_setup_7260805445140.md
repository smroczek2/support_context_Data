# Donation Setup
In order to collect Donations through UltraCamp, you'll first need to make a category, then a template under that category.


 


## Donation Categories


Donation Categories provide heading and information text as well as help organize donation items for reporting purposes. This video shows how to create a Donation Category.



  
  



## Donation Templates


Donation Templates offer donors the ability to make a donation. Donation Templates can be set to allow a variety of scenarios within a single donation category. This video shows how to create a donation template as well as what the client sees when reviewing donation options.
