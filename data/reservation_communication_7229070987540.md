A Confirmation email can also be sent to the client upon successful completion of the registration process. A Confirmation email can be set up either on an individual session basis or for all sessions scheduled from this template.

* To enable customizable, session-based confirmations, check the box to **Automatically Send Email Confirmations to Clients** and leave the Confirmation Master menu set to “Do not use a Confirmation Master.”
* You can then type default message text for the Confirmation E-mail in the appropriate field.
