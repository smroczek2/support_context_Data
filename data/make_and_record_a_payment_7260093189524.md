	2. Click the **Make / Record a Payment** button (on either the *Account Detail* or *Finance Detail* pages)
	3. Click **Credit Card Payment**

		+ If your organization is set up to use *Convenience Fees*, the calculated fee will display here. To override the fee, uncheck the **Automatically Calculate** box and adjust the fee in the text field. The Payment Total will display below.
		+ Add **Comments**to the payment using the text field. Any text you enter here will be displayed in confirmation correspondence sent to the client.
	2. **Provide Credit Card Information** by choosing one of the available options:  
	  
	
		+ **Use a new credit card** by entering the required information.
		+ Select an existing credit card if it has been previously entered
	3. Click the **Submit / Schedule Payment**


 


**Why no CVV?**At this time, UltraCamp doesn't use the Credit Verification Value (CVV) for several reasons. CVV is a fraud prevention device but it cannot be stored. This means that CVV prevents all scheduled payments. Instead UltraCamp uses Address Verification Service as fraud prevention. In addition to allowing scheduled payments to work, it also gives you lower interchange rates with your merchant processor.


  
  



## Additional Options


* UltraCamp will automatically allocate these funds on its own, but you can override this and allocate the funds manually by checking the box to *Specify how this payment should be applied*.
* *Print a Receipt* of this transaction,
* Schedule multiple additional payments using this payment method by checking the appropriate box. Here you'll be able to add multiple amounts for specific dates.
* By default, UltraCamp will perform an address verification security check on the card.  However, you can bypass this by unchecking the box to *Perform address verification on this transaction*.

## How ACH Payments Work


* ACH payments transfer money electronically from an individual's bank account to yours.
* This payment functions very much like a check payment and is processed through the Automated Clearing House (ACH). ACH payments function very much like paper checks--they take several days to clear and may be returned if there are insufficient funds in the designated account or account information is incorrect.


## 


## ACH Pre-Notes and First Time Payments


* The first time an ACH payment is made, UltraCamp must verify that the bank account entered actually exists.  To verify an account, UltraCamp sends a Pre-Note.  This Pre-Note behaves like a transaction and takes 3-5 business days to process but doesn't incur processing fees and doesn't withdraw any money from a bank account.
* If the Pre-Note confirms the entered account is real, UltraCamp submits the ACH payment for processing.  This extends the time between when a first payment is initiated and when it is received.  However, after an account is confirmed this process will not be repeated, and all future payments will process normally.
* If the Pre-Note cannot confirm the entered account, the ACh payment is not processed and no fees are incurred by your organization.  An alert is sent to the client about the payment failure.
