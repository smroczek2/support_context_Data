# Quick Buttons
In addition to UltraCamp's default communication links, you can create custom Quick Buttons that automatically retrieve a custom Email Template and automatically attach any documents you have uploaded.


To find where to create and edit quick buttons, take the following steps:


1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the "Communication" section.
2. Click ['Quick Buttons'.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/correspondenceButtonsList.aspx)


## How to Create or Edit Quick Buttons


To set up a quick button, you'll first need to create a customized Email Template. You can learn how to [create Email Templates here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/9973916676372). Once this is done, you can take the following steps to add or edit a Quick Button to your reservation detail page:


1. Click "Create a New Correspondence Button" or the edit link next to an existing correspondence button in the list.
2. Enter the **Button Name**. This will appear below your button wherever it is displayed.
3. Select your **Email Template** from the dropdown.
4. Choose the page where you want your button to appear, either the **Reservation** **Detail** or the **Retreat Reservation Detail**.
5. Click the button to **Save** your changes.


You should now be able to find your new Quick Button under the Correspondence section on the selected page.
