# Background Checks
UltraCamp offers integrated background checks through True-Hire. Background checks can be submitted on National or National and Regional levels. Submitted background checks will incur additional fees based on your region and the type of check run Background checks are an option available under extra services.

## How Background Checks Work


TrueHire offers three variations of the background check, the Basic background check, the Standard background check, and the Standard Background Check Plus. In addition, a Motor Vehicle check can be added to either of these.


All background checks begin with the individual's, name, Social Security number, and birth date and runs a trace to confirm their identity and find any aliases or other names the individual may use or have used.

The Basic Background Check is recommended for staff and volunteers who will not be left alone with campers. For individuals who will be responsible for children and alone with them, the Standard Background Check provides better information and protection.


When running a background check, a pop-up window will warn you if additional fees apply.

In addition to the background check, you may elect to run a Motor Vehicle check. This searches for DUI and vehicle offenses listed for the current driver's license.


The cost of Motor Vehicle check is $7.75 plus the DMV/Court fee. These fees vary widely from state to state.

## FAQ: Background Checks


Background checks are available UltraCamp through [**True Hire**](https://true-hire.com/). Some personal information is needed to run a background check. 


 


### Why Is A Social Security Number Needed?


One of the greatest misconceptions about background checks is most people think that criminal records are attached to an individual’s social security number. In fact, criminal records are stored on one’s name and date of birth. If you were to search a criminal record database with no tother identifier besides a name, you would see criminal records for everyone with that name.  
  
True Hire conducts a social security number trace on every applicant to ensure that we are background screening the exact person you are looking for. This SSN Trace provides us with a closer look into your applicants address history and shows any former names they may have had. Using this information, True Hire will accurately match any criminal records found on both the national and county level with your applicant.


 


### How The Applicant's Information Protected?


True Hire’s background check system is fully secure and robust. We take all security measures when dealing with personal identifying information (PII). We understand that your applicant’s information and data is important, and we take the responsibility seriously. Additionally, our database is secured with a standard SSL certificate. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard technology securing internet connection and protecting any sensitive data that is being sent between systems.  
  
True Hire has a full in-house team of certified investigators that have both the knowledge and experience to conduct complaint background checks. You can rest easy that your applicants’ information is bot secure and protected.


 


### Is True Hire Accredited?


True Hire was recently awarded accreditation by the Professional Background Screening Association Accreditation (PBSA). This means that we go above and beyond to provide our clients with accurate background checks and excellent customer service while following strict compliance and data security protocols.


 


### How Does UltraCamp Handle Sensitive information?


UltraCamp is a secure website and requires a password or account to access. We also do not store your information like Social Security Number where anyone, not even you, can see it. In fact, once you enter the data and hit submit, the data immediately becomes encrypted on our server where no one can access it. Even if you, the user, reloads the page where you entered it previously, it does not show and can not be read.  
  
Since the background check process is integrated directly in to UltraCamp, there is never a time where you have to leave your information in an email or enter it into a third-party site.
