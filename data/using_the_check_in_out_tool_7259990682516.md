# Using the Check In/Out Tool
Administrators can mark an attendee for an ongoing session as either *Checked In* or *Checked Out*, logging arrival and departure in your UltraCamp database. 


The **Check-In / Check-Out** feature not only records the current status for an individual and but allows you to track who dropped off or picked up an attendee, record comments, and review historical data.    


**To access the Check In / Out Tool:**


1. 1. Go to the Tools menu
	2. Click on Reservations
	3. Select [Check In / Check Out](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/tools/checkInOut.aspx)





 


Selecting the [Check-In / Check-Out](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/tools/checkInOut.aspx) link will bring up a list of any reservation where today's date falls between the Session Begin Date and the Session End Date.


* You can then use the radio buttons to either Check In, Check Out, or take No Action regarding the attendees status.
* **Comments** can also be added to the status for reporting purposes.
* Use the **Save** button to record any changes in your database.
