# Setup ACH for Payment Processing
## What is ACH?


ACH (Automated Clearing House) is a banking network that coordinates electronic payments and automated money transfers and is a way to move funds between banks without using paper checks, wire transfers, credit cards, or cash. For UltraCamp, that means it is another method for your clients to submit payment electronically.


## Why should I use ACH?


The biggest reason to use ACH is that it costs your organization less processing fees than credit card payments (approximately 1/3 of the fees incurred by credit card transactions). ACH payments do take longer to clear than credit cards, but they function similarly in every other regard.



#### 
 ACH Fees


Here are the fees you can expect from enabling ACH transactions:


* $5.00 monthly ACH connection fee (only charged in the months that you are taking ACH payments/refunds)
* $0.50/transaction
* 1% of each transaction
* $2.50 returned ACH fee
* $0.25 batch fee

## How to Enable ACH for your Organiation


Setup for ACH is done through the [My Settings Wizard](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/wizards/setup/default.aspx). You'll first need to add your organization’s bank account in the Finances section, then enable and complete a two-part ACH Setup in the Client Payments section. Below you will find directions to address each of these parts of setup:


### Adding a Bank Account


To add a banking account, take the following steps:


1. Open the **Settings** menu and expand the **System Management** section
2. Select [My Settings](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/wizards/setup/default.aspx) to access the wizard
3. Proceed to the [Account Information](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/billingaccountinfo.aspx) page in the "Finances" section
4. Enter your banking account and routing numbers in the space provided
5. Click the **Next** button (lower right corner) to save

### Step 1: ACH Payment Setup


Once you've enabled ACH payments, you need to request an application using the following steps:
