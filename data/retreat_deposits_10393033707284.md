## Create and Edit a Retreat Deposit Types


You can create deposit types in the [**Retreat / Conference Center wizard**](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Wizards/RetreatSetup/Default.aspx). Once a deposit type been set up, it will display on the [Deposits](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/RetreatSetup/deposits.aspx) page in the wizard. Deposit types will also be available to add to any retreat reservation you create.


Create a new Deposit template by clicking the **+** icon or the words "Add Retreat Deposit Type" in the gray heading bar.


You can adjust existing Deposit templates by clicking "Edit" to the right of the listed item.


Whether creating a new deposit or editing an existing one, you'll need to address the following settings:


* + The deposit **Name** will show both to admins who are adding the deposit to a retreat reservation and to the public when they review their reservation communication.
	+ Choose with **Deposit Type** you'd like to apply to this template. This will determine what happens to the deposit if a retreat reservation is cancelled:
		- A **Non-refundable** deposit will continue to apply as a fee on a client's balance after event cancellation.
		- A deposit that is set to be **100% Refundable** will not apply to a client's balance if their reservation is cancelled.
		- A deposit that is set to be a **Custom Percent Refundable** will require that you enter that percent so UltraCamp can calculate how much of the deposit will be kept as a fee upon cancellation.
	+ The **Deposit Amount** is the default value of your deposit. This can be manually adjusted by an admin when it is added to a retreat reservation.
	+ Choose either Percentage or Dollar for the Deposit Amount Type to tell UltraCamp how to calculate the Deposit Amount.
	+ If you wish the Deposit Amount to be its own additional fee on top of all other reservation fees, check the box to **Add deposit amount to reservation balance**. Only use this checkbox if you do *not* wish payments toward the deposit to count toward other fees on the reservation.
	+ You may choose an **Allocation Account** for monies assigned to the deposit. This will allow for separate financial tracking for retreat deposits using this template, but this is optional.


When you are finished, click the **Insert** button to save a new Deposit Template or click the **Update** button to save changes to an existing Deposit template.
