1. 1. Open the desired account
	2. Click on **View Financial History** and proceed to the Finance Detail page
	3. At the bottom right, expand the **Additional Actions** menu
	4. Click on **Store Deposits**


## 
Unspent Money


Indicate how unspent money should be dealt with using the radio button options:


* Each individual with a store deposit will be listed independently here.
* Click View Purchase History to see what items have been purchased through the Point of Sale system.
* The Current Balance will be displayed to the right.
* To add money to the individual House Account in the Point of Sale system, use the Add Money column to enter the desired amount.


  
  




#### 
 Tip


Why is the Store Deposit option not showing? There are typically two reasons the option to add or edit store deposits isn't showing:


* Check to see if they have a reservation. Depending on your camp settings, an individual may need to be registered for a current or upcoming session in order to add money to their Point of Sale account.
* Make certain the Session Template for a current or upcoming reservation has "Collect Store Money" checked on the Registration Information page of the Session Template Wizard.
