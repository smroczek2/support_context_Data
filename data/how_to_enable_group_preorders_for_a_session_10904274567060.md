# How to Enable Group Preorders for a Session
If you want leaders to be able to reserve slots for members of their group, you will need to first have a **[Group Preorder Template](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/10848101419796)**. Once you have created your template, you can enable it for a session by taking the following steps:


1. Open the **Session Editing Wizard** for the session you want to work with.
2. Navigate to the **Capacity** page in the **Basic Settings** section.
3. Choose the appropriate **Group Preorder Template** from the dropdown menu.
4. Click the **Complete** button.


With your changes saved, you can exit the wizard.


The session is now enabled for Group Preorders. When anyone registers, they will be prompted to indicate if they are signing up individually, as a member of a group, or as a group leader. If they select the "group leader" option, they will be guided through the steps of reserving spaces.
