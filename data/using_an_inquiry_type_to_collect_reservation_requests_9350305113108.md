# Using an Inquiry Type to Collect Reservation Requests
UltraCamp makes it possible for potential clients to request a retreat reservation even before creating an account. To enable this feature, you will need to create a customized Inquiry Type. You will also want to add questions to this Inquiry Type. Once these two steps are done, clients can submit requests from the default [Contact Us](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/config/links.aspx) link or by using a direct link you make available to them.


 


## Creating a Custom Inquiry Type


To create a custom Inquiry Method, take the following steps:


1. 1. Go to the Settings menu, click on "Communication," and select [Inquiry Types.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Inquiries/InquiryTypesList.aspx)
	2. Click on **New Inquiry Type**
		* Inquiry Type Name: fill this out with a name of the information you will be collecting (eg Summer Camp, Retreat Rentals, Outdoor Education).
		* Select user responsible for this inquiry type: The User that you assign as responsible for this type of inquiry will be who receives notice that a new inquiry has been filled out.
	3. Select **Save**


You'll need to save the Inquiry Type in order to access the option to add Custom Questions. The basic inquiry type will require:


* + First Name
	+ Last Name
	+ Email Address
	+ a Message / Comments


It will also have options for other contact information, including street address and phone.



#### 
 Note


If your organization runs individual reservations in addition to Retreat reservations, it is important to create a separate Inquiry Type for questions about your individual reservations and programs.

## Adding Custom Questions


If you wish to collect more information about the retreat reservation, you will need to add Custom Questions to the Inquiry Type.

* Click **Add a new question** if would like to create questions right now.
