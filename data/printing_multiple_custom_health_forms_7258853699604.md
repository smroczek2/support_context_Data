# Printing Multiple Custom Health Forms
If your organization is using a custom online form to collect health information, you can print multiple forms at once. This text guide reviews how to do this quickly and easily with the use of a stored group.


  


## 


  
  



## Step 1: Create a Stored Group


* Most reports can generate a stored group.
* Choose a report that gives you list of the individuals for whom you wish to print medical forms.
* When you run the report, use the **upload icon** to save this information as a stored group.
* If you use a custom report, look for a Store this information link instead of the icon.


## 


## Step 2: Retrieving Your Forms


Once you've created a Stored Group with individuals for whom you wish to print the forms,


1. 1. Go to the **Reports** menu and expand the **Forms** section.
	2. Click **Online** Forms.
	3. In the **Select Form** dropdown menu, choose your Health History Form. This will bring up an additional set of filters.
	4. In the **Who is also in** dropdown menu, choose your stored group from Step 1.
	5. Click the **Search** button.
	6. [Optional] In the list of forms, uncheck boxes of any forms you do NOT want to print.
	7. Scroll to the bottom and click the **Print Selected** button.


This will queue the process of generating your pdf and redirect you to the My Jobs page.


 


## Step 3: Downloading the PDF from My Jobs


When you click the **Print Selected** button, each Health Form that has a checked box to the left will be submitted to the **My Jobs** processor. You will also be redirected to the My Jobs page.


On the My Jobs page, you will see your Health form queued up and then begin to process. When the job is complete, an icon will display.


* Click the icon to request a download of the combined Health Form PDF file.
