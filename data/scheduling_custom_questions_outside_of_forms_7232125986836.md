# Scheduling Custom Questions Outside of Forms
Custom Questions can be used to gather information on an accounts, individuals, and reservations. Most often, Custom Questions are used in [Custom Online Forms](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7231482555284). However, there are situations where you may want to ask a question outside of a form. There are three places you can add questions outside of an online form: 


* During account creation
* When creating, editing, or confirming an individual person on an account
* During registration for a specific session


These three scenarios offer different ways to collect information and are managed outside of the Online Form tools.


**To add, reorder, and remove Account, Person and Session Custom Questions:**


1. 1. Go to the Scheduling menu
	2. Expand Custom Questions
	3. Click the appropriate link for Account, Person or Session Custom Questions

 Tip


Person Custom Questions work best for collecting individual information which does not change. Clients will only answer these questions when they first create the individual account member or when prompted to update their information as part of the registration process. Use Custom Online Forms for greater flexibility and to collect data that may change from year to year.



 


## Session Custom Questions


Session Custom Questions are used to gather non-financial information about a particular session reservation.


**To add a new Session Custom Question:** 


1. 1. Select the session from the dropdown menu
	2. Choose the desired custom question master from the **Select Question** dropdown menu.
	3. Check Confirmation to include this information in the Confirmation email.
	4. Next click the **Add Question** This shifts the question to the currently scheduled Account Custom Questions listed below.

 Tip


Session Custom Questions are best used to track information that could vary if the attendee were to also enroll in another session. The best example of this is a buddy or cabin-mate request.


For information that could carry over from session to session, we recommend using [**custom online forms**.](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7231482555284)
