# Store Deposits (Point of Sale)
## Store Deposits


If your organization is using the Point of Sale system, store deposits can be managed within UltraCamp. Changes made here directly affect House Accounts in the Point of Sale system.    


**To Manage Store Deposits:**


1. 1. Open the desired account
	2. Click on **View Financial History** and proceed to the Finance Detail page
	3. At the bottom right, expand the **Additional Actions** menu
	4. Click on **Store Deposits**


## 
Unspent Money


Indicate how unspent money should be dealt with using the radio button options:


* Each individual with a store deposit will be listed independently here.
* Click View Purchase History to see what items have been purchased through the Point of Sale system.
* The Current Balance will be displayed to the right.
* To add money to the individual House Account in the Point of Sale system, use the Add Money column to enter the desired amount.


  
  




#### 
 Tip


Why is the Store Deposit option not showing? There are typically two reasons the option to add or edit store deposits isn't showing:


* Check to see if they have a reservation. Depending on your camp settings, an individual may need to be registered for a current or upcoming session in order to add money to their Point of Sale account.
* Make certain the Session Template for a current or upcoming reservation has "Collect Store Money" checked on the Registration Information page of the Session Template Wizard.

# Setup ACH for Payment Processing
## What is ACH?


ACH (Automated Clearing House) is a banking network that coordinates electronic payments and automated money transfers and is a way to move funds between banks without using paper checks, wire transfers, credit cards, or cash. For UltraCamp, that means it is another method for your clients to submit payment electronically.


## Why should I use ACH?


The biggest reason to use ACH is that it costs your organization less processing fees than credit card payments (approximately 1/3 of the fees incurred by credit card transactions). ACH payments do take longer to clear than credit cards, but they function similarly in every other regard.



#### 
 ACH Fees


Here are the fees you can expect from enabling ACH transactions:


* $5.00 monthly ACH connection fee (only charged in the months that you are taking ACH payments/refunds)
* $0.50/transaction
* 1% of each transaction
* $2.50 returned ACH fee
* $0.25 batch fee



## 


## How to Enable ACH for your Organiation


Setup for ACH is done through the [My Settings Wizard](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/wizards/setup/default.aspx). You'll first need to add your organization’s bank account in the Finances section, then enable and complete a two-part ACH Setup in the Client Payments section.

3. Proceed to the [Account Information](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/billingaccountinfo.aspx) page in the "Finances" section
4. Enter your banking account and routing numbers in the space provided

3. [Optional] If the average payment by your clients is $1000.00 or more, use the button to upload 3 months of bank statements for your organization
4. Click the **Request Application** button.


This will submit a request to our payment processing team. They will send the Docusign application packet to the person designated in Step 1. When this is submitted, it usually takes about two business days for the application to move through review unless more documentation is requested.


 


### Step 2: ACH Settings


Once the application is approved, and the camp is enabled by payment processing for for ACH, **Step 2** will become available. You will receive an email to let you know when this occurs. You can then return to the My Settings wizard and to finish setup:

	4. Enter your ACH Settings in **Step 2**
		* Select **ACH Contacts** to receive relevant ACH communication from UltraCamp
		* Set your **Returned ACH Fee** for payments that bounce
		* Set your **ACH Error Fee** for payments that are returned for account information errors
		* [Optional] Set a convenience fee and an associated allocation account
		* If you want to encourage ACH use, check the box and enter your own encouragement text if you don't want to use UltraCamp's default

# How To Send Mass Email
# Add, Edit, or Enter Medications

	2. On the Account Detail page, click on the appropriate individual's name under Account Members.
	3. In the Medications menu on the right, click the **View / Edit** link.


## 



 


## Adding a New Medication


1. 1. Enter the **Medication Name**in the field provided.
		* Based on what you begin typing, UltraCamp will suggest medication names from a list of FDA approved medications.
	2. You may select from this list or enter a different med name.
	3. Select the **Route**for medication administration from the dropdown menu.
	4. In the **Schedule / Dosage**section, use the Select Schedule dropdown menu to indicate when the med should be administered and what the dosage should be.

#### 
 Tip


"Deleted" medications can still be reported on in the Medications roster.



 


## How a Client Enters Medications


It can be helpful to see what a client sees when entering medication. Here we will review the function and layout of the public page for adding and editing medication. Most clients will add medications as part of their initial registration process.


To see the medications page from the public point of view, you also may make a reservation, but there is a short cut to the Medications page itself. 


**Use the following steps to go directly to the Medications page:**


1. 1. Access an account (like the Test account).
	2. Click the Public View icon in the upper right. This will take you to the public side.
	3. Click on an account member's name. This will take you to the Person Detail.
	4. Use the **Manage Medications** button under Common Tasks OR in the expandable menus on the right, locate the **Medications menu** and expand it.
	5. Click the **Manage Medications** link to be redirected to the appropriate page.


Clients can also follow these steps to add or edit medications outside the registration process.


 





 


## Adding a New Medication

* **Route:** Select the Route for medication administration from the dropdown menu.
* **Schedule/Dosage:** In the Schedule section, indicate the time of day as well as the days of the week when the medicine should be administered. You can also indicate different dosages and specific times as necessary.
* **Reason for Medication:** You may also add any Reason for Medication / Comments in the field provided.
* **Save Medication:**When you have added the appropriate information, save your changes by clicking the Save Medication button. This will record the medication in the system, and it will display under Current Medications below.
* **Save and Proceed:**When you have finished entering medication information, click the Save and Proceed. This will return you to the Person Detail page.

# Facility Templates
Facility Templates are used to manage both facilities for the Retreat / Conference module and lodging for sessions. These templates are re-usable from season to season and event to event. Facility categories must be created before facility templates.

**To create or edit a Facility Category:**


1. 1. Go to the Settings menu.
	2. Expand the Facility Templates.

	4. Select an **allocation account***(optional)*using the dropdown menu. Once an allocation account is selected, all revenue gained from this facility category will apply to the specified account (unless overridden on the facility itself).
	5. Use the **Category Type** menu to indicate whether this is a "Facility," "Lodging," or "Meal" type facility. This feature is particularly useful when using the Retreat Center.
	6. By default, the Active box is checked. Uncheck this box only if you wish to deactivate the facility category.

For more detailed breakdown of the different settings that can be used in each section of an Option Template, see the information below:


## Display Information Details


**Category Name**


* Select the Category Name to indicate the Category to which this option will belong.


**Sub Category**

* The use of Sub Categories is optional.
* Subcategories are not designed to be lengthy but can permit up to 99 characters.


**Option Name**


* The Option Name is the actual choice your client will select.
* The Option Name will show in their shopping cart, on the Reservation Detail page, and multiple other places in the system.



#### 
 Tip


If you wish something other than the Option Name to display in custom reports, you may enter a Short Name in the text field provided. For example, this can be used to abbreviate how a report displays an option named "Adult Medium T-Shirt" to "Adult M" or just "M."



**Display**


* By default, UltraCamp displays options in alpha-numeric order.
* You can override this by setting a Display Rank within Category.
* Options with a lower rank will be displayed first and alpha-numerically within the same rank.
* For options that represent a month and day and are set up in a mm/dd format, UltraCamp can display the weekday for the current year before the description.
	+ Checking the box to **Prepend description with weekday name** will display the Option Name, the weekday for the current year, and then the description.
	+ If this option is to be selectable by clients in the registration process, check the box to **Display to public** in registration process.


**Display When Unavailable**


* When an option is no longer available for selection, UltraCamp hides it from the public view.
* You can override this setting so when this option is closed, it is still listed (but not selectable) along with other options by checking the box to **Display to public when unavailable**.
* Check the box to **Display this option on the Session Information page** along with the Session Description for any session to which this option is attached.


**Option Quantity**


* If Clients can purchase more than one of this particular option, check the box that **Clients need to specify the quantity being purchased**.
* This will add a quantity field to the left of the Option name. This field defaults to 1 but can be adjusted during option selection in the registration process.
* By default, UltraCamp only displays whether or not this option is available. However, you can Display the number of available spaces / items remaining by checking the appropriate box.
* On the option selection page in the registration, clients must select their desired options by checking the box or button to the left of the option name.
* However, by checking the **Display selected by default** box, this option will be pre-selected for them.


 


## Fees Details


**Non-refundable Fee**


* An option’s total fees are determined by the combination of the Non-refundable Fee and the Cost (less deposit).


**Cost (less deposit)**


* The amount to Collect at Registration can be adjusted here.
* This amount will be collected in addition to the fees the Session is set to collect at registration.
	+ Exception is when sessions set to “Collect all fees at registration,” in which case the fees for this option would be collected anyway, regardless of the Collect at Registration amount).


**Free to Age/Free Over Age**


* This option can be set to be Free to Age and / or Free over Age which prevents this option's fees from applying to people below or above the specified ages respectively.


**Cancellation Fee**


* A Cancellation Fee can be set to automatically apply to a client’s account should they cancel or remove this option from their reservation.
* This is in addition to any Non-refundable Fee.


**Allocation account**


* If this option’s fees need to be tracked separately from other fees, you can indicate a distinct Allocation Account for this specific option.


 


## Availability Details


**Availability Limit**


* The Availability Limit determines how many of this option are available to your clients.
* This is a required field--even if you offer an essentially unlimited number, you will still need to put something in this space. For example, you could enter 9999 as the availability limit.


**Age/Grade Restrictions**


* You can restrict the availability of this option by Age or Grade using the dropdown menu.
* If you choose to limit availability this way, you may then set Minimum and Maximum parameters in the resulting fields.
* If this option is used with group reservations, you can have UltraCamp charge the fee for this option per paying registrant.
* Check the box to enable this feature so that With group reservations, [UltraCamp will] count and charge as one per paying participant.


 


## Additional Settings Details


**Confirmation Note**


* If this option is selected, a special Confirmation Note can be included in the Confirmation Email.
* Type in this field to add the note.


**Option Documents**


* UltraCamp can also attach pdf Option Documents to the Confirmation Email if this option is selected.
* These documents must be uploaded separately (in the Settings Menu) and will attach in addition to any other Confirmation Email documents.


**Option Online Forms**


* When an Option Online Form is selected, UltraCamp will prompt the client to fill out the checked Custom Online Form.
* If this form is not otherwise added to the registration process, only those who choose this his Option Online will see the online form.
* This feature can be used for waivers connected with an optional feature—like a day rafting trip—or a financial aid request that triggers an application form.
* The selection of this option can trigger an Option Payment Plan to display in the checkout process if that payment plan is checked here.



#### 
 Tip


An example of using this feature would be with an option to apply for financial aid. The selection of this option would trigger a payment plan unique to Financial Aid applicants - perhaps a plan where they can check out without paying.



**Nest Options**


* UltraCamp can nest options from one category within options from another.
* If this option shows up only if another option is chosen first, indicate that **This option is a child** of the triggering option by checking the box to the left of the triggering option.
	+ For example, if Hot Lunch is an option for this program, selecting the Hot Lunch Option could then trigger a Sandwich, a Spaghetti, and a Pizza option. The specific meal options - Sandwich, Spaghetti, and Pizza - would each be marked as a child of the Hot Lunch option.


**Allow Cancellations or Quantity Reductions**


* By default, UltraCamp does not allow a client to cancel or reduce their option selections.
* If you want to permit this behavior, check the box to Allow cancellations or quantity reductions .


**Enable Check In/ Check Out Feature**


* By checking the box to Enable the check in / check out feature , you can use the Session Options Roster to mark the option Fulfilled.


 


## Update, Delete or Save Details


**Update All Flexible Settings**


* Once an option is saved, a checkbox to Update all flexible settings to all upcoming scheduled options to match these settings will appear.
* Changes to flexible settings on the Option Template will not normally affect options that are already scheduled.
* If you make a change to a flexible setting on the Option Template and wish to push this change to already scheduled options (for current and future sessions), check this box and click the button to save the Template.


**Delete this Master**


* Deleting an option template will remove it from all upcoming sessions as well as remove the template from the list.


**Save Option Master**


* Whether creating a new option or editing an existing one, you must click the Save Option Master button at the bottom of the page.

## 


## Watch Video: Creating Simple Discount Templates



## 


## Simple Discount Terms and Settings


Below is a detailed explanation of each setting for a simple discount:


### Basic Information


Several of these settings are required. Enter optional information as desired:


* The **Discount Name** is required will appear to the client in several places, including the cart and reservation detail.
* [Optional] A **Description** will appear to the public on the **Discounts** page in the registration page and on the registration information page.
* [Optional] Enter a question for clients to answer in the **Question Prompt**.
* [Optional] If using a Question Prompt, you can also indicate a set of **Pre-Determined Answers** for the client to select from. Separate each answer option from the next with a comma.
* This master template can be set to be *either* a percentage- *or* a dollar amount-based discount.  A **Default Amount** must be entered, but the exact numbers can be adjusted on a session by session basis. The type of discount (dollar or percentage) cannot be tailored per session.
* [Optional] Select an **Allocation Account** from the dropdown list for financial tracking
* Verify that the **Enabled** box is checked (Unchecking it will prevent the discount from being scheduled for new sessions but doesn't unschedule it or affect sessions to which this discount has already been added.)


### Behavior


Select the desired discount **Behavior**by checking and unchecking the appropriate boxes:


* **Allow the public to alter the default value of this discount** lets clients choose their own discount amount during registration (although your default amount will show in the text field).
* The **If value is a percentage, recalculate value if modifications to the reservation are made** setting determines whether the original discount amount changes when the reservation fees are modified.  This only works for percentage-based discounts.
* For group-based sessions, UltraCamp **can apply this discount for each participant**, so that a reservation with 3 participants would receive the discount amount multiplied by 3.  This only affects group reservations and discounts that are a dollar amount.
* If the custom discount is to be publicly available for clients to select, it should be marked **visible to the public in the registration process.**
* If the custom discount should be visible on the administrative side of the registration process, it should be marked **visible in the admin registration process**.
* If you wish clients to be able to see the amount of the discount before they get to the cart page, check the box to make the **value of the discount visible in the registration process.**
* If you indicate that **this discount should be selected by default**, the client won’t need to select the discount in order to apply for it—it will be applied for automatically.
* UltraCamp can **automatically approve discounts when they are applied for** by a client.  Otherwise, an administrator on your staff must go in and review and approve the discount.
* Choosing to **display information about this discount on the session information page** will cause the discount details to show along with the Session Description, dates, and other specifics.


### Limits


Limits are an advanced setting and should be used with caution. They put permanent boundaries on who and how much this discount template can be redeemed for. You will be able to limit *when* a simple discount is open when you schedule it.


* A simple discount can be limited by an  **Age/Grade Restriction** so it only displays for and applies to individuals falling within the specified range.
* A **Maximum amount per season** can be used to limit how much is given away by this discount.  When this dollar amount is reached, the discount will no longer be able to be claimed.
* You can also restrict how many time this discount can be claimed by setting the **Maximum claims per season**.
* Setting a **Distinct Code Claim Limit** will set a maximum on the number of times a single discount Code can be claimed.


  
  



## Discount / Coupon Codes


A discount can be claimed via a discount code or codes.  A discount must be saved before you can add codes.  Once added, codes will abide by the **Behavior** and **Limits** settings specified on the discount.


To add a code, take the following steps:


1. Click “Add a new code.”
2. In the resulting popup window, you can enter a single **Code** or, by checking the **Add Multiple Codes** box, enter several codes at once.  Codes are case sensitive.
3. Select the Code Type.  There are four different **Code Types**:
	* A **Single Use** code can be used only once in the system.
	* A **One per person** code can be redeemed once for each individual who uses the code.
	* A **One per account** code can only be redeemed once in any given account.
	* A **Multiple Use** code can be redeemed once for each reservation, regardless of the number of reservations or individuals using the code.
4. [Optional] Enter a **Maximum Total Value** to set an upper limit for the total amount of money which can be given away by the discount code.  Once this limit is reached, codes will no longer be redeemable.
5. [Optional] Enter a **Maximum Number of Claims**to limit the number of times this code can be redeemed.  Once this limit is reached, the code will no longer be redeemable.
6. Click **Save Discount Code** to add the code.


Added Codes are immediately functional and can be redeemed on the cart page by clients prior to checkout.  


Discount code restrictions count across seasons and therefore can affect and restrict the redemption of a discount in subsequent seasons.  In other words, a Single Use code could only be used once ever in the system.  For this reason, it is typically recommended that old codes be deleted from the template to avoid confusion.

**To set up Pricing and Fees in the Session Template Wizard:**


1. 1. Go to **Settings menu.**
	2. Expand **Session Templates section.**
	3. Click on **Session Templates.**
	4. Create a **New Session Template** or edit an existing template using the **edit icon** to the right of the desired template.

	\***Note:** if you previously clicked "Do not display this page to me again", you will not see that page.
	6. In the left menu, click on **Pricing and Fees.**


## 
1579809056541-st-pricing-fees.png


 



  
  



## Group Pricing


For Group/Family based Templates and reservations, fees tend to be more complicated than Individual-based sessions. 


**Non-refundable fees are not designed to work with Group/Family sessions and should be avoided.**


If a **Basic Fee**is entered, it will be charged per person on the Family Registration.


* Special pricing structures can be created to accommodate age or group size-based pricing as an alternative.
* Group pricing structures are created in the **Settings menu** and attached on a session/event basis.


If a **non-refundable fee** for a Group-based session needs to implemented:


* Use the **Collect Another Amount feature** to collect a deposit and adjust the **Modification cutoff date**to prevent clients from cancelling their own reservations.
* You and your staff may add in a non-refundable fee at the point of cancellation should that become necessary.


 


## Individual Pricing


* For an Individual based Template and session, Total Fees are derived from the sum of the Non-refundable Fee and the Cost/Basic Fee.
* The Non-refundable Fee can work like a deposit and is kept as a fee when a client cancels a reservation on their own.
* All of the Cost/Basic Fee will be removed from a client’s statement if they cancel on their own.


 


## Alternate Fee Labels


In the registration process, the Non-refundable Fee and Basic Fee will display as these terms. 


* Using the **Alternate Non-refundable Fee Label** and the **Alternate Basic Fee Label**, however, you can replace the default terms with language of your own.
	+ These are fixed settings and will therefore affect all sessions/events created using this Session Template.
* The **Alternate Price Description** can be used to set text to display rather than the Total Fees as part of the selection and registration processes.


 


## Collection Method


The Collection Method determines how much a client must pay before completing their reservation. 


* The method of collection is a fixed setting, but the actual numerical amount is flexible and can vary based on your fees.


**Collection Methods are as follows:**


* **Collect all fees when the reservation is made**requires your clients to pay all fees at checkout in order to complete their registration.
* **Require only the deposit**collects the Non-refundable Fee as a minimum but also allows clients to pay more than the minimum—up to and including the full amount.
* **Payment in Full or Payment Plan** requires that the client pay for everything at checkout or sign up for a Payment Plan. Payment Plans are created elsewhere and added on a per session/event basis.
* **Must Select a Payment Plan** requires the client to choose a payment plan in order to complete their order. Payment Plans are created elsewhere and added on a per session/event basis.


 


## Balance Forward Requirements


You can require that balance forwards be paid using the drop-down menu in the Session Templates wizard.


* Requiring that **balance forwards** from previous seasons be paid at registration for a new season’s session is a good way to prevent returning attendees from building up large amounts of outstanding debt from year to year.
* Selecting **Collect any overdue balances** will require payment for even current season reservations to be paid before selecting a new one.


 


## Allocation Account


An Allocation Account can be set in the Session Template as a default for all sessions scheduled from this template.


* Scheduled sessions can have their allocation account changed on a case-by-case basis.
* To set an Allocation Account, select it from the dropdown menu.


Allocation Accounts are created in the **Settings menu > Accounting >**[**Custom Allocation Accounts**](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/AllocationAccounts.aspx?return=AllocationAccountsList.aspx?confirm=true).


* They can be connected to sessions either in the Session Templates wizard or in the Session Editing wizard.


 


## Paid in Full Reminders


UltraCamp can generate Paid in Full reminder emails automatically from an email template in the system. 


* Up to 3 reminders can be scheduled.
* These emails will trigger based on the specified Paid in Full Due Date (which is set up on a per session basis in the scheduling process).
* You can set how many days before that specified date these messages will send.
* UltraCamp uses a default reminder email template (which is personalized to each individual record), but you can replace this with a template of your own design.


#### 


#### **Example: Default Reminder Email Text**


**[Date]**


**[Your Header]**


This is a friendly reminder that the following reservation must be paid in full before**[Paid-in-Full Due Date]**.


**[Session Name] [Attendee Name]**


Your current reservation balance is $**[Amount].** To access your account and make a payment, click here.


If you have questions, please contact **[Organization Name]** at **[General Phone Number]** or via email at **[General Camp Email]**.


 


 

# Gender Expressions
By default, UltraCamp presents two binary genders when an individual is added to an account. Through Gender Expression, this binary list can be adjusted and expanded. This affects what a client sees on the public side as well as reporting and display on the administrative side of UltraCamp.


To adjust the Gender Expression list:


1. 1. Go to the **Settings menu**
	2. Expand **System / Management**
	3. Click **Gender Expressions**


 


## Gender Expressions


Gender Expressions permit the addition to and editing of gender in the biographical information of an individual. However, lodging and capacity are still coded in a binary fashion throughout UltraCamp. By default, these two gender expressions are displayed as Female and Male (although they can be edited).


 


## Create a New Gender Expression


1. 1. **Enter Name:**When creating a new gender expression, you'll need to first enter a Name that will appear to your clients in the gender dropdown menu as well as your reporting.
	2. **Enter Short Name:***(optional)* Enter to replace the name in reports and on the Individual and Account Detail pages.
	3. **Binary Gender Mapping:**Because UltraCamp can determine capacity and lodging assignment limits based on a binary gender, each newly created
		* Gender Expression must be linked to one of the two default binary genders.
		* This Binary Gender Mapping enables the use of capacity limits and lodging assignments. It can be reported on and will display in parentheses on the admin side but will not be visible to the public.
	4. **Binary Gender Action when Selected:**When a Gender Expression is selected, UltraCamp will perform one of three actions regarding the default binary genders:


**A. Changed to the Mapped Gender:**(Default behavior) 


* + - * When this option is selected, UltraCamp will identify the individual with both the Gender Expression and the binary gender listed in the Binary Gender Mapping selected above.
			* The Binary Gender mapping is NOT visible to the client.


**B. Leave Assigned Gender Unchanged:**


* + - * When this option is selected at account creation, whatever previously assigned binary gender has been selected will be retained, regardless of the Binary Gender Mapping selection.
			* If this is the first time a client has selected Gender, the Binary Gender Mapping will be used.


**C. Pend for Review:**


* + - * When this option is selected, the individual's binary gender will be flagged in our Gender Expression Review report (reports>biographical>gender expressions).
			* Here, admins will be able to administratively identify the appropriate binary gender for lodging and capacity. Until the review is completed, the mapped binary gender above will be used.
			* By default, UltraCamp will display Gender Expression options in alpha-numerical order from top to bottom in the dropdown menu. You can override this by specifying a Display Rank. Lower numbers will be displayed before higher numbers, with matching numbers being sorted alpha-numerically.


5. **Click the Save** button to complete your changes and save them to the database.



## 


## Edit or Delete Gender Expressions


Existing gender expressions can be edited or deleted. When a gender expression is deleted, all records linked to that gender expression will be deleted and revert to the mapped binary gender.


* To edit an existing Gender Expression, click the **Edit or Pencil** icon to the right of the desired expression.
* To delete an existing Gender Expression, click the **Delete or X** icon to the right of the desired expression.

* **Who Is Also In:** Another way to filter the Medications report is to look for any individual who Is also In a specific stored group. The dropdown menu will display any stored group that has idPerson in it. Select the desired stored group to limit the report to only individuals within that group.

# Authorized Pickup
An **Authorized Pickup** is someone who has permission to pick a child up from one of your programs. Each account has its own distinct set of authorized pickups. By default, this includes the Primary Contact, but it can include others as designated by the Primary Contact or an admin.


 


## Collecting Authorized Pickup Information


When authorized pickup is enabled in the My Settings wizard, you can add a page to your registration process to collect this information. Depending on your setup, this can be done in one of two ways:


* Through the Registration Page Order page in the Session Editing wizard for your session
* Through the Page Order Template found in the Settings menu > Session Templates > [Page Order Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/pageOrderMastersList.aspx)


Authorized pickup information can also be collected from the Account Detail page. This is done by expanding the **Pickup Authorizations** menu and clicking [Edit Authorizations.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/accounts/editAltPickup.aspx)


 


## Frequently Asked Questions


**Can I turn off Authorized Pickups in UltraCamp?**


Yes. Go to the My Settings wizard (Settings menu > System / Management > My Settings). Proceed to the [Authorized Pickups](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/altpickups.aspx) page in the "About My clients" section. Here you can turn Authorized Pickups off.


 


**Can I set up a Do Not Pickup List?**


We recommend training your staff to only release campers to people on the Authorized Pickup list. However, if you wish to add a "Do Not Pickup List," you can use a Custom Online Form.


 


**Can I be notified when the public updates their Authorized Pickup Information?**


Yes. Go to the My Settings wizard (Settings menu > System / Management > My Settings). Proceed to the [Authorized Pickups](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/altpickups.aspx) page in the "About My clients" section. Here you can select an administrative user to receive notification of adjustments.

# Getting Started with Discounts
Discounts are a common feature in setting up pricing for sessions, and UltraCamp offers several ways of implementing discounts. However, it is important to remember that the more complex your pricing, the difficult it will be for parents to predict their costs as well as for the system to accurately accommodate. At UltraCamp, our experience affirms the old saying: "Keep it simple, Silly!"


 


## How Do Discounts Work in UltraCamp?


Discounts are attached to a session and reduce the overall cost of that session. Discount stack with each other and calculate off the total session fees. You can track discount approval and financial totals through UltraCamp's reporting tools. Different types of discounts handle various pricing scenarios:


* **Multi-week Discounts** are fully automated discounts that add automatically when a specific number of sessions are purchased
* **Volume Discounts** are generally frowned on due to their unpredictability but add automatically when a total balance threshold is met.
* **Simple Discounts** are flexible discounts that can be triggered by date range, code or even a checkbox. *These are the most versatile and commonly used type of discount.*
* **Membership Discounts** are dollar amount discounts that can add automatically when a designated membership item is selected.
* **Paid-in-full Discounts** automatically trigger when a reservation is paid for completely at checkout or can be added to a reservation later if it is paid by a specific date.


## 


## How Do I Set Up Discounts?


There are two parts of setup for most discounts:


1. 1. Create a Discount Template.
	2. Schedule (or add) the Discount to one or more sessions.


Membership and Paid-in-Full Discounts do not need a template.


 



#### 
 Tip


You can learn how create and add discounts through our [Discount articles here!](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/sections/7110612880916-Discounts)



 


 


## Discount FAQs


**Which discount type should I use if I want to do a sibling discount?**


If you like the idea of a sibling discount being completely automated, use the Multi-week Discount. However, if you need to make a lot of exceptions, you will probably want to use a manually approved Simple Discount.


**Which discount type should I use if I want to do an Early Registration discount?**


Simple Discounts work great for this. You can set a date range that will automatically turn the discount off at a specific point in time.


**How do I give away a free week or session?**


A Simple Discount with a code can be set to cover 100% of the session costs.


**How do I keep discounts from applying to the Session Options I've added?**


There is a setting on the Option Category that can exclude all options in that category from being covered by discounts. Look for the checkbox labeled "Discounts can apply to options in this category," and make sure it is unchecked.


**Can I make it so if a family gets one discount they can't get a different discount on the same reservation?**


No. You can set a limit on the value of discounts an individual can receive on a specific session, but all eligible discounts will stack with one another.

# Accrual Based Accounting

How to use UltraCamp in an Accrual-based accounting setup

# Completion Monitoring
Completion Monitoring allows an admin to track a client's progress through the registration process. Monitoring starts once a client selects a session. If they then do not complete the registration, an automated reminder email will be sent to them. This email contains a link back to that specific session along with an invitation to finish the process. Admins can view statistical information on both complete and incomplete registrations by running the Completion Monitoring report.


## 


## Turn on Completion Monitoring


Completion monitoring must be turned on in the My Settings Wizard before automated messages can be generated. 


**To turn on Completion Monitoring:**


1. Go to the **Settings** menu
2. Expand **System Management** and **click on My Settings**
3. Expand **About My Clients** and select **Completion Monitoring**  

4. Send Automated Notices to Clients is checked by default
	* If a client does not complete the registration process, they will be sent a notification along with a link back to the incomplete session
	* Uncheck to disable notifications for incomplete reservations
5. Click **Complete**



#### 
 Note


The Automated Notice email cannot be customized or edited.



 


## Report Parameters


1. Go to the **Reports** menu and expand **Reservations**
2. Click on **Completion Monitoring**
3. Enter Search parameters
	* **Begin Date:**Enter date range or leave blank to view all dates
	* **Status:** Select from the dropdown menu
	* **Account number:** if you want to view a specific account or leave blank to view all accounts
	* **Client Notified:** check if you want to see who was notified about the incomplete reservation (this only works if notifications are enabled)
4. Click **Search**  



  
  



## Results


From the results window, admins can check registration status and view where clients are stopping in the registration process. This is helpful in identifying trends that may be hindering registration completion.




# Session Template Overview
Session Templates in UltraCamp function as starting points for all sessions you will schedule from season to season. Our favorite analogy is a stencil. It has an outline and a shape, but no details. Use the template as an outline, then fill in your details in the Session Editing Wizard. Your session comes to life when you schedule it.


**To create a Session Template:**


1. 1. Click on the **Settings Menu.**
	2. Expand **Session Templates.**
	3. Select **Session** **Templates.**



 


## Key Terms


**Fixed Settings**


* Determined on the template only.
* Designated by a lightning bolt.
* Settings remain true on every item scheduled from this template.


**Flexible Settings**


* Adjusted and customized as needed in each separately scheduled program.
# Price Definitions in the Retreat Module
UltraCamp uses Price Definitions to make assigning a cost to facilities easy. While you can enter a price directly to a facility, a price definition can look at Begin and End Times and quantity and calculate the price for you.


 


## Setting up Price Definitions


To set up Price Definitions, you will need to take the following steps:


1. 1. Navigate to the **Settings** menu, expand the **System / Management** section and click on [Retreat / Conference Settings.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Wizards/RetreatSetup/Default.aspx)
	2. In the wizard, go to the [Price Definitions](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/RetreatSetup/pricedefinitions.aspx) page in the Pricing section.
	3. Click the icon to Add Price Definition.
	4. Enter a Name for the P**rice Definition** and default **Price**.
	5. [Optional] Check the box for **Per Item / Person** for pricing that is based on a quantity.
	6. Indicate the **Price Frequency**.
		* *Per Use* charges the price for each time the facility is added to a reservation.
		* *Per Hour* charges the price for each hour calculated by the Begin Time and End Time of the facility.
		* *Per 24 Hours* charges the price for each 24 hours (or portion thereof) calculated by the Begin Time and End Time of the facility.
		* *Per Night* charges the price once for each night for which the facility is reserved calculated by the Begin and End Date.
	7. Click the Insert button.


You can add multiple Price Definitions by following these steps but may need to click the Cancel button if you wish to edit a definition you've already added.


Once you are satisfied with your Price Definitions, you will need to connect them to your Facilities to actively use them.


 


## Connecting Price Definitions


To connect your Price Definitions, take the following steps:


1. 1. Go to the Settings menu, expand the Facilities Templates section, and click [Facility Templates.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/FacilitiesList.aspx)
	2. Click on the desired facility.
	3. In the Retreat / Conference Center Reservation Defaults section, check the box for the Price Definition(s) you wish to add.
	4. Click the **Save Facility** button.


Now when you add a facility to a Retreat Reservation, you will have the option to choose this Price Definition from the dropdown menu.


 


## FAQ for Price Definitions


**Why isn't my Price Definition showing when I go to add facilities to a reservation?**


The most common reason is that the Price Definition has not been connected to the facility you are adding. Double check to make sure the proper price definition is checked on the facility template.


 


**What Price Frequency should I use for meals?**


The most common Price Frequency for meals is Per Use. This will charge your price rate for each time the meal is added to the reservation.


 


**What Price Frequency should I use for my lodging?**


In most cases, lodging will use Per Night as the price frequency. This will charge your price for each night that lodging is used during the retreat reservation. If you are charging a flat rate instead of a nightly rate, choose the Per Use price frequency instead.


 

# Should I use Activities or Options?
Both Activities and Options offer additional choices and selections as part of registration. Deciding which one to use depends on the features and preferences of what you want to implement.


**Options** are designed to let individuals make selections from a list of one or more items.


**Activities** are designed to let individuals choose their own schedule from a list of selections.

| Template can be reused in the same session | Yes | No |
| Works with Group Reservations | No | Yes |


 


## When should I use Activities?


Use Activities when an individual should make one or more selections that correspond to a part of a day. Here are some examples of when activities work well:


* If an individual must choose a morning class and an afternoon class
* If an individual can sign up for a wait list if an activity is full but still must choose one with openings (in case space doesn't open up)
* If multiple sessions share the same class rosters and capacity limits


 


## When should I use Options?


Options are much more commonly used than activities. Use options when you have pricing that changes based on the number of selections made. Here are some examples of when Options are the best choice:


* For setting up a Day Camp where people can select individual days
* For group registrations where a family selects lodging for their reservation
* For optional add-ons to a reservation like extra care,

# Imports
## Terms


* **Legacy Account ID:**ID provided by organization to group individuals into the same account. An example of individuals who belong in the same account together would be immediate family members.
* **Legacy Person ID:**Unique ID provided by organization that is assigned to each person being imported.
* **idAccount:** Account ID number assigned by UltraCamp to the account when the import takes place.
* **idPerson:** Unique ID number assigned by UltraCamp to each person being imported.
* **Primary Contact/Parent 1:** Main individual on the account who manages the account.
* **Secondary Contact/Parent 2:** Second adult on the account. Usually the other parent or guardian for the family.
* **Child/Participant:** Any individual who is not the primary or secondary on the account. Usually the children of the family.


## 


## Step 1: Prepare your data for import


The first and most crucial step in the process is to prepare your data for import. A data set laid out in an organized manner will make the import process faster and more accurate. 


* Laying your data out in the manner described below for the bio import will go a long way to make the other imports run smoothly.
* Separate files for each import are better than one massive file.


Each import section below will have directions and an example on how to lay out the data for importing.


 


## Step 2: Bio import


The bio import is the first and most important. This sets the foundation for all other imports. In the bio import you will be taking all the individuals and placing them along with all their bio data in UltraCamp accounts. 


* Key aspects of this import are the **Legacy Account ID** and the **Legacy Person ID**.
* Row 4 is an example of an account that has no campers. Leave columns blank if there is no data for that person.



#### 
 Warning


Both ID's are important, but the**Legacy Person ID** is the most important. Without the Legacy Person ID, we will not be able to perform other imports. If you do not have a Legacy Account ID, we can match people based on address and/or last name.





#### **View Import example of column headings.**



*Click on small horizontal scroll bar to view all columns*






 


## Step 3: Other imports


Examples of Reservation and Donation Import are available below. Import examples for Online Form, Retreat Reservation, and Membership are available by request.

	2. Click the Complete button to save your changes and proceed to the next page.



#### 
 Tip

## Basic Information Page


On the Basic Information page, you will need to enter appropriate data into at least the required fields—you can ignore any fields that don’t apply.


  



### 


### Basic Information Fields


**Session Name**


* Adjust the Session Name from the Template Name if appropriate.
* This is a required field.


**Sub Categories**


* These create a visual division of sessions whenever they are listed together on UltraCamp.
* Sessions with the same Sub Category name will be grouped together with the Sub Category as the header.
* **Sub Category 2** displays within **Sub Category 1**.


**Location**


* Assign a Location from the dropdown menu.


**Session Code** 


* If your organization uses Session Codes, you can enter this session’s code here.


**Begin Date/End Date** 


* These will indicate when your program or event starts and finishes.
* These are required


**Alternate Date Label**


* Date range for events is displayed in a mm/dd/yyyy – mm/dd/yyyy format (e.g. 6/14/2020 – 6/19/2020).
* You can replace this with an **Alternate Date Label** of your choice.


**Daily Start and Daily End time**


* If this session repeats daily during the Begin and End Dates, it can be set with a Daily Start and Daily End Time.
* This is particularly useful for daily repeating courses.
* UltraCamp will display a Daily Start and End time if entered.


**Time Description**


* This replaces the Daily Start and End Time with whatever text you enter in this field.


**Registration Begin Date**


* This determines when clients can go online and register for this session.


**Registration End Date**


* Determines when public registration by clients is disabled.


**Modification Cutoff Date**

* You and your staff can cancel a reservation at any time.
* The Cancellation Cutoff Date defaults to the Registration End Date if you leave this field blank.


**Paid-in-Full Due Date**


* When this date arrives, clients will be required to pay for the entire session in order to register, regardless of the Payment Option.
* Depending on the Session Template settings, it can also trigger balance due reminder emails.
* The Paid-in-Full Due Date defaults to the Session Begin Date if you leave this field blank.


**Complete Button:** 


* Once you’ve entered the appropriate data, click the Complete button to save your information and proceed to the next page of the wizard.


### 


### Next Step


On this page you will be offered three options:


1. 1. Selecting **Schedule another session** will take you back to the Session Master page to repeat the process.
	2. Choosing to **Continue working with this session in the Session Editing Wizard** will allow you to use the Session Editing wizard to adjust the default settings for this specific session.
	3. Electing to **Copy settings to this session from a previously scheduled session** will take you to the Copy Settings wizard where you can copy some specific settings from another previously scheduled session.


 


## Editing Capacity


To change the capacity in a session you first need to enter the session editing wizard.


 



  
  



  
  



  
  


# Session Wait List
Waiting lists give you flexibility when setting up a session. When a session reaches capacity, you may wish to allow clients to sign up for a waiting list. In the event that a space opens up then they will be able to register for that session. 



#### 
 Note


* Being on the waitlist is not part of the registration process.
* Once space opens, clients will need to complete the reservation process.
* If a session is full and has a waiting list, spaces that open up are held for the waiting list.  They are not available for the public to claim without first signing up on the waiting list.



**Opening Up Session Spaces**


There are two ways session spaces can open up:


* Increasing session capacity by an administrator.
* By canceling or moving reservations.


**Notification of Availability**


* The waiting list can function in an automated way, notifying people in the order they signed up or it can be managed manually.


## Set Up Waiting Lists For Individual Sessions


1. 1. Go to the Session Editing Wizard.
	2. Click on Scheduling.
	3. Expand Sessions.
	4. Select Sessions.
	5. Click Edit.
	6. Select Additional Information.
	7. Click Session Waiting List.





**Edit Settings Details**


* **Enable:** make sure this box is checked if you want to offer a waiting list option.
* **Signup Cutoff Date:** This is the last day a person can sign up for the waiting list. After this date, the waiting list will no longer show up as an option to sign up for.
* **Process To Start On Sign Up:** If you would like to attach a process you have created in UltraCamp, you can do so here (this is uncommon).
* **Email Send When Space Becomes Available (Notifications):**
	+ **Manual Method:** If you would like to manually manage the waitlist, set this to ‘Do Not Email’. With this setting, no one on the waitlist will be notified when space opens up and the administrator may register anyone they would like from the admin side in UltraCamp for the open space.
	+ **Automated Method:** If you would like to automate the waitlist process, we highly recommend leaving the email message on ‘Use Default Message’. UltraCamp will send an automated email that will include the person, session and time limit a person has to register for the session once space has opened up for them.
		- * + - Below is a sample of the email that a person will receive


 





* **Days Opening Should be Held:** When space opens up in a session and a person is notified via email, a hold is placed for this person. This setting dictates how long that hold lasts until the person is removed from the waiting list and the space is then offered to the next person on the waiting list. The default is set to 0 (for no limit). This will hold the space in the session for a person on the waiting list until the session begin date or they are removed from the waiting list manually.


## Increase Session Capacity


1. 1. In the Session Editing Wizard, go to Basic Settings.
	2. Click on Capacity.
	3. Increase the Capacity as needed.
	4. Perform Waiting list check:  Checking this box will send the waiting list emails right away when the capacity is increased (instead of waiting until the next morning).



#### 
 Note


This checkbox is an action, not a setting. It needs to be checked each time the capacity is increased if you wish to send the emails immediately. This checkbox does not enable the waiting list. If it is checked and the waiting list has not been enabled in the waiting list settings, no action will occur.



1. 5. Click Complete to save changes.


 


## View the Waiting List


1. 1. Go to the Reports Menu.
	2. Click on Reservations.
	3. Click on Session Waiting List.
	4. Check the box next to a session.



#### 
 Note


Only sessions that have people signed up on the waiting list will show up here.



1. 5. Click Search.



#### 
 Note


Individuals will have an overall priority number on the waiting list as well as a gender priority (for sessions that limit space base on gender).



 


## Edit Priority Number or Remove From List


* When viewing the waiting list, click ‘edit’ next to a person to change their priority on the list.
* Remove a person from the waiting list by clicking ‘delete’.


 


## FAQ


### How do I let people in to a session from the waiting list?


* Space can open up for a session when there is a cancellation.
* UltraCamp will check for open space in a session’s capacity and will automatically send an email each morning to eligible people on the waiting list (if these emails are enabled on your settings).
* Increase the capacity on the session.


### How does a person complete registration once they receive email that space is available?


* A person can either click the link in the email directly to register for the session or they can log into their UltraCamp account and register for the session.


  
  


# Agreements Are Going Away
Agreements are an old tool that is being phased out for the benefit of everyone who uses UltraCamp.


When UltraCamp was first created back around 2000, expectations of security along with our understanding of legal accountability were different than they are today. At that time, a page with a button that made a registrant click an "I agree" button was thought to be adequate to ensure compliance with things like refund policies and behavior requirements. It was (and is) simple to set up and enable. However, there was no way to certify that someone clicked that button or even saw the page. These limitations still exist today.


Because there are no tracking features built into Agreements, we now recommend that you use **Custom Online Forms** for anything a client must agree to. We will be removing the old Agreements function entirely from UltraCamp's feature list in the near future.


 


## How to Switch to an Online Form


If you have an existing Agreement that you'd like to change into a Custom Online Form, there are several steps you'll need to take:


* + Copy the important text from your Agreement.
	+ Create a new Custom Online Form with that text.
	+ Add the new Form to your registration process.


#### Copying Agreement Text


To copy Agreement Text, you can try the following:


1. 1. In the **Settings** menu, expand the **Communication** section.
	2. Click Agreements.
	3. Click the Edit icon to the right of the Agreement you wish to copy.
	4. Use your mouse to select the desired text from the **Agreement Text**.
	5. Either use your keyboard shortcut to copy the text or right click to select Copy.
	6. [Optional] Paste the text into a text editor for safe-keeping.


#### Create a Custom Online Form


Creating a custom online form is a bit more complicated than creating an agreement, but the Custom Online Form wizard will guide you through the process. Take the following steps to create an online form:


1. 1. In the **Settings** menu, expand the **System / Management** section.
	2. Click [My Forms](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/config/forms.aspx).
	3. Click **Create a new form**.
	4. In the wizard, give your form a **Form Name**.
	5. Choose the form type from the **Individual or Account** dropdown menu.
		* Choose **Account** if this agreement holds true for everyone on the account.
		* Choose **Individual** if this agreement pertains to a specific person on the account (usually an attendee)
	6. Click the **Complete** button.
	7. Select **Require clients to attest that the form is complete**.
	8. In the **Signature Collection** dropdown, select "Collect Electronic Signature."
	9. Click the **Complete** button.
	10. Skip the Notifications page.
	11. On the Layout page, click "Add Text."
	12. Paste your copied text into the **Text** field.
	13. Set the **Display Style** to "Directions."
	14. Click the **Save** button.
	15. Click the **Complete** Button.


You can exit the wizard now that your Custom Online Form is complete. If you'd like to know more about the other settings you can use for your form, check out our [Online Form Help Guide here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7231482555284).


#### Add a Form to the Registration Process


Depending on your session setup, there are two ways to add an online form to the registration process.


* + The **Registration Page Order** page in the **Session Editing Wizard**
	+ The [Page Order Template](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/pageOrderMastersList.aspx)


In either case, you will need to drag your from out of "Online Forms" section and drop it in the "Registration Process" section.


You can learn more about how to add your new form to the registration process in our article "[Setting Your Registration Page Order](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/10556700559380)."


 

# Dispensing and Administering Medication
 The administration of medication can be logged in UltraCamp on an individual level. This is helpful when dealing with one person specifically, rather than a number of individuals at once.    


To log the administration or dispensing of medications for an individual, there are two ways to log information for an individual:


1. 1. **In the Health menu:**
		1. Expand the Recording section.
		2. Select Record Dispensed Medications.
		3. On the resulting page, type the account number or part of the name in the Select the Account field.
		4. Once you've identified the correct account, Select the person for whom you wish to dispense medications from the dropdown menu.
		5. Click the Next button.
	2. **Open the appropriate account:**
		1. Click on the desired individual under Account Members.
		2. Expand the Medications menu on the Person Detail page.

# Adding a New Filter
To determine the records from which to return data fields, UltraCamp requires Filters.  The filters you place on a report determine whose information is returned in the report. Multiple filters can be combined to restrict the data returned.


By default, UltraCamp places a custom filter in every newly created report. This filter narrows the list of returned data to only individuals who are enrolled in the current calendar year. If this filter conflicts with your desired return information, you can delete it using the link to the right.



## 


## Add a Filter to This Group


1. 1. Click on the Add a filter to this group link. This will bring up the Filter Creator popup.
	2. In the Filter Creator, you can select which kind of filter you wish to add.
	3. The creator then will walk you through the next steps.


## 


## Select Filter


There are four categories of Filter that you can select from in the Filter Constructor.


* **Simple Filter**is used to perform comparisons between data fields of greater than, less than, equal to, or not equal to.
* **Exists filte**r looks for a specific ID number in the system.
	+ This includes idSession, idPerson, idAccount, a Reservation ID or even an Option Exists filters can be used to create checklist prompts for a variety of filter scenarios.
* **Custom filter**adds a blank set of parameters which you can then edit and manipulate using the Field Editor.
	+ You will need to add a Left Operand, Operator, and Right Operand in order for it to function properly. This is an advanced process and not necessary for most reports.
* **Pre-done Filters**these are the most universal and common filters and are included to make filtering simple for most reports.
	+ They include filters for all attendees in the current year, all attendees for upcoming sessions, and a prompt filter where the user can indicate via checkbox which sessions they wish to include in their report.
	+ A variety of Pre-done Filters can be added.


 



#### 
 Tip


You can add multiple filters to a single Filter Group. UltraCamp will process these filters in order from top to bottom. You can use a combination of filters to return very specific data sets.



 


## Add a New Filter Group


Multiple filter groups can be combined to create complex filter logic. 


* When two or more filter groups are added, they can be compared with either an And comparison or an Or comparison.
* UltraCamp will process all the filters in each group and then compare one group to the other.


### 


### Multiple Filter Group Example:


The desired report should collect information on boys who are 10 years old and girls who are 12 years old. 


* A single filter group would be unable to achieve this result since it is not possible for a single person to be both 10 years old and 12 years old as well as be both a boy and a girl.
* By creating two different filter groups with the "OR" condition between them the report will return anyone who meets the criteria in either filter group 1 or filter group 2.





### 


### Filter Symbols


When working with filters, you may be required to use or at least understand a series of symbols. Below is a key to help you interpret those symbols--you can read the equivalent phrase in place of the symbol.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **=** | **Equal To** |
| **>** | **Greater Than** |
| **<** | **Less Than** |
| **< >** | **Not Equal To** |

## 
Sending a Telephone Broadcast


UltraCamp can help you broadcast a mass automated phone message to specific accounts within your database. Using this tool will provide you with a phone number and access codes to record and send that message through our connected call service. Sending a phone broadcast incurs additional charges. The fees are as follows: $5.00 per month in which the service is used and $0.10 per phone number called.    


**To send a telephone broadcast:**


1. 1. Go to the **Tools** menu and expand the **Correspondence** menu.
	2. Select [**Phone / Text a Stored Group**](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Correspondence/PhoneSMSBroadcast.aspx) in the **Correspondence** section.
	3. In addition to completing this page, you will also need to call the number provided and record your message.


### 
General Settings


1. 1. From the dropdown menu, select the **Stored Group** you wish to contact.
	2. Enter a **Broadcast Name**.
	3. Description is optional but can be entered for log purposes. It has no impact on the actual message.



#### 
 Note


By default, UltraCamp will designate the broadcast to go out **15 minutes** from when you access this page. You can adjust the Send Date to a specific time in the future using the calendar and time picker.



 


### Phone Broadcast Settings


* **Send Phone Broadcast:**Checking this box will bring up additional settings for the message.
	+ **Caller ID:** This determines what number displays to the message recipient. This number defaults to your organization's phone number. You can adjust that number using the field provided.
	+ **Send to:** Indicate which numbers you wish the message sent to by checking one or more phone from the list.


Click the **Next** button to proceed.


### 
Recording Your Message


On the subsequent page, you'll be provided with a number to Call , your Camp ID , and this message's unique Broadcast PIN. Call the number listed and follow the automated directions to record your message. You will need both your Camp ID and the Broadcast PIN to complete this process.


## 
Sending an SMS / Text Broadcast


UltraCamp can help you broadcast a mass SMS / text message to specific accounts within your database. Sending this kind of broadcast incurs additional charges. The fees are as follows: $5.00 per month in which the service is used and $0.02 per phone number texted (SMS).    


**To send an SMS / Text broadcast:**


1. 1. Go to the Tools menu
	2. Expand Correspondence menu
	3. Select [**Phone / Text a Stored Group**](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Correspondence/PhoneSMSBroadcast.aspx) in the Correspondence section.


### 
General Settings


* **Stored Group**: Select the Stored Group you wish to contact.
* **Broadcast Name:** This is the name or title for the message and is required.
* **Description:** This is optional but can be entered for log purposes. It has no impact on the actual message.
* **Send Date:** By default, UltraCamp will designate the broadcast to go out 15 minutes from when you access this page. You can adjust the Send Date to a specific time in the future using the calendar and time picker.


Ignore the Send phone broadcast checkbox


### 
SMS Broadcast Settings


1. 1. Check the box to *Send SMS broadcast*. This will bring up additional settings for the message.
	2. Type or paste your message into the *SMS Text Message*
		* UltraCamp displays the number of characters you have remaining just below the field.
		* The maximum number of characters is 160; this includes spaces and punctuation.
	3. Indicate which numbers you wish the message sent to by checking one or more phone from the list. It is generally recommended that all 3 boxes be checked, since a cellphone may be entered as either the primary phone or one of the alternate phones.



#### 
 Tip


UltraCamp will only send text and SMS messages to phone numbers that have checked the box agreeing to receive such messages. This is done at account creation but can be edited on and individual level later as well.



1. 4. Click the **Send**button to queue the broadcast


 


### **Why only 160 characters?**


SMS technology limits a message to 160 characters. Longer messages are broken into smaller chunks and then reassembled at the receiving end. However, this assembly process can be problematic, resulting in confusing messages so at this time if you wish to send longer messages, you'll need to compose and send them separately.


 


  
  



  
  


# Transaction Summary
The Transaction Summary report identifies and details transactions based on when they are initiated in UltraCamp.   


To create a Transaction Summary Report:


1. 1. Click on the Reports menu
	2. Go to the Financial section
	3. Click on Transaction Summary
	4. Enter or check optional report parameters
	5. Click Search


  
  



## Report Parameters


* **Transaction Types:**The Transaction Summary report can be filtered to return one or more Transaction Types.
	+ By default, the report will return All Credits and All Debits. You can adjust this to any one or combination of credits and/or debits.
	+ By unchecking the box next to All Credits, you can select specific credit types. This will restrict the report search to just those credit types you indicate by checking the associated box.
	+ By unchecking the box next to All Debits, you can select specific debit types. This will restrict the report search to just those debit types you indicate by checking the associated box.
* **Card Types:** Use the Card Types filter to restrict the report search to Visa, Mastercard, Discover, or any combination thereof.
* **Season:** The Transaction Summary report defaults to the current Season. You can run this report for any specific season or combination of seasons by checking the associated boxes.
* **Dates:** Often a narrower date range than an entire season is desired. Use the calendar picker and Dates fields to restrict the report parameters even further.
* **Last Name:**The search for this report can be focused on transactions submitted by primary contacts with a specific Last Name by entering all or part of the name in the field provided.
* **Account #:** Where a specific account is being examined, you can enter its Account # in the field provided.
* **Check #:** The Transaction Summary can be used to search for the specific Check # of a specific check recorded in UltraCamp.
* **Amount:** The Amount field can be used to search for transactions that are equal to, greater than, less than, or not equal to a specific dollar amount.
* **Entered By:**Use the Entered By dropdown menu to filter for transactions entered by a specific administrative user. By default the summary will not restrict the search based on who entered the transaction (All Users).
* **Text in Memo:** Transactions can be searched for based on text entered in the transaction's Memo field. Simply enter all or part of the desired text in the Text in Memo field.
* **Reconciled Status:**Your search can also be restricted to transactions with a specific Reconciled Status.
	+ Using the dropdown menu, you can look for transactions that are part of a batch that has been Reconciled with the gateway and settled into your bank account.
	+ You can also look for transactions that are not part of a reconciled batch or whose batch has not been reconciled by using the Unreconciled menu item.
	+ By default, the report returns All transactions regardless of reconciliation status.


 



#### 
 Tip


The Reconciled Status filter works best when searching for Credit Card and ACH Payments. Custom Credits, Cash, and check payments (any non-electronic payment) is not batched and recorded automatically, so these transactions will show under Unreconciled Transactions unless you filter them out under the Transaction Type.



 


### Display Allocations


In addition to a list of distinct transactions, the Transaction Summary report can display how those transactions are allocated. 


* Checking the **Display Transaction Allocations** box determines how those allocations are organized and presented at the bottom of the transaction list in the **Transaction allocations for found transactions**section of the report.
* This information can be saved as a stored group separately from the list of transactions above it.
* Check the box to Only display allocations and not transactions to hide the transaction list.


### 


### Report Type Menu Options


The Report Type dropdown menu offers three options:


* **Detail Summary:** This breaks down allocations by Allocation Account. Within each allocation account section, the transactions are summarized by transaction type and listed by Session Name within each payment type.
* **General Summary:** Allocations are broken down by Allocation Account and transaction type.
* **Item List:**This offers a variety of optional groupings for the allocations portion of the report. You may indicate which parameters you'd like to group the allocations by.
	+ When the Report Type is set to an "Item List," you can indicate which way you'd like to Group Report By.
	+ The various options are presented with checkboxes and can be combined for differing results.


 


Most are self-explanatory but there a couple of specific combinations detailed below:


* **Allocation Account#:**Check the Allocation Account # box to receive totals for each account number. This option combines well with checking the Allocation Account Name and  with any of the date or season options.
* **Uncheck** all boxes to return a detailed breakdown of every allocation of every transaction. This includes transaction type, primary contact, session name, area, amount, allocation account number and name, etc.


 


**Search:** When your parameters are set, click the Search button to run the report.

#### 
 Note


In order for a Multi-week Discount to trigger and add automatically to reservations, it must be scheduled for those sessions. You can learn about how to [connect a Multi-week Discount to sessions here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7228503425940#adding-a-multiweek-discount-0-0).




#### 
 Note


Multi-week Discounts work only with Individual-based sessions. They do not work with Group-based reservations.  To reduce pricing by the number of participants in a Group-based reservation, you'll need to use a Group Pricing Structure.

## Multiweek Discount Terms and Settings


Below is a detailed description of each of the settings on Multiweek Discount Templates:


### Basic Information Setting Details


* The **Discount Name** will appear to the client in several places, including the cart and reservation detail.
* This template can be set to be percentage- or a dollar amount-based.  A **Default Amount** must be entered, but the exact numbers can be adjusted on a session by session basis.  The type of discount (dollar or percentage) cannot be tailored per session.
* You may enter a **Description** in the field provided.  This description will show on the Discounts page in the registration process.
* You may wish to uncheck the box to **Display this discount to the public in the registration process** if you don't have other discounts displaying. This will hide the discount in the registration process, although it will still appear in the shopping cart and confirmation.
* You may also uncheck the box to **Display this discount on the session information page**.


### Automatic Approval Setting Details


* Designate how many reservations it takes to trigger this discount using the **Required Reservations**
* To make this discount a sibling or multi-person discount, check the **Applied Across Account** box and indicate how many different individuals it takes to trigger this discount in the field to the right.
* You can put a maximum discount **Limit** on the template that is a per person limit or per account limit.  This will prevent an individual or account from receiving a greater discounted amount than you specified in the field.
* This discount can **Apply to** a reservation in two different ways.  You can either set it so that **all reservations that meet the above criteria** receive the discount, or you can stipulate that only certain reservations receive the discount.  Individuals or reservations can be prioritized based on **Order Date, Session Begin Date, Session Order Total,** or **Person Order Total**.


 


 


## Example Multi-week Discount Templates


Since Multi-week Discounts can cover a variety of scenarios, here are some example templates:


### Second Session Discount


With the following setup, the Multiple Session Discount offers $250 off the second session if a single individual makes a reservation for two or more sessions.  However, they only get the discount on the second session (and not subsequent sessions).


* **Name:**Second Session Discount
* **Default Amount:** 250 dollars
* **Description:** Sign up this individual for a second week and automatically get $250 off that week.
* **Required Reservations:** 2
* **Applied Across Account:** Unchecked
* **Apply to:** Reservations starting with **reservation** number **2** and include reservations up through number **2**.  Determine the order of reservations by sorting them by **Session** **Begin Date** from **Earliest (Smallest) – to Latest (Largest)**.


### Sibling Discount Example


With the following setup, the Sibling Discount is supposed to offer 5% off for each individual if a family signs up more than one child.


* **Name:** Sibling Discount
* **Default Amount:** 5 percent
* **Description:** Sign up more than one child to automatically receive 5% off each reservation.
* **Required Reservations:** 2
* **Applied Across Account:**  **If checked, enter the minimum number of different people required:** 2
* **Apply to:** all reservations that meet the above criteria.
# Send an Email
## Emailing an Individual


To email the primary contact, navigate to the account you want to communicate with. 


* Use either the **Send an Email** button under Common Tasks on the Account Detail page, or you can use the icon wherever it is displayed.
* Additionally, clicking the email address link in various locations will also bring up this tool.





## 


## Regular or Advanced Tool


* By default, the Send and Email tool will walk you through several pages of settings in order to generate your email. Use the Next button to proceed from page to page.
* To the right of the subsequent page is a checkbox that says Use advanced email tool. Checking this box will display all the sections of the email tool in a single scrolling page.


## 


## Send Information


* **Subject Field:** Enter the subject line for the email. This is a required field.
* **From field:** Select any email address from your list of users or the general camp email address as the email of origin.
* **CC Field:** If an email address is entered in the CC field, that email address will receive a copy of the email as well.
* **To line:**The primary contact and her/his email will be displayed here.


## 


## When should the email be sent?


* **Send Date:**This determines when a queued email will actually begin to transmit. If this field is left blank, the queued email will begin to transmit 15 minutes from when you press the Send button. You can set the Send Date to any other time using the calendar and time pickers.
* **Request Read Receipt:**The recipient's mail client must have this feature enabled in order for this to function correctly.
* **Emergency:** An email can be designated as an emergency email by checking the Emergency box. This bypasses other email processes and queues the message for immediate delivery. This option should only be used for emergency situations.


## 


## Email Templates


* **Save as New Template:** Email messages can be saved as templates for repeated use using the Save as a new template link. This will bring up a popup window where you can name the template and indicate whether you wish to save its attachments as well. Use the Save Template button to store your template in the database.
* **Load an Email Template:**Once a template has been saved it can be edited by selecting it from the Load an Email Template dropdown menu. You can change the content of the template and use the Save link to save your changes. Use the Delete link to remove the template from the database permanently.


## 


## Email Content


The creation of the email message takes place in the Email Content section. At the top of this section are Formatting Tools which can be used to help compose your message or even paste it in from an external source. The function of each button can be seen by holding your mouse over it. Below the buttons is a row of dropdown menus for indicating Font Name and Size.


* **Links to UltraCamp:** In addition to these formatting options, you can also add Links to UltraCamp to the email. To do this, place your cursor in the composition area below where you want the link to show then select the desired link from the dropdown menu.
* **Personalization Fields:** These can be used to tailor the message to individual recipient. Selecting a field from the dropdown menu will place code at your cursor in the composition area. When the email is queued, UltraCamp will replace this code with information from the account or stored group. For example, selecting the personalization "primary\_nameFirst" would insert the first name of the primary contact into the recipient's email.
* **Insert Content Here:** The message itself is written over the text "Insert content here" below your logo and contact information.
* **Display of Message:** At the bottom of the composition area, you can adjust the display of the message from the Design view (the default view) to the HTML view where you can interact with the html directly or to a Preview mode which hides the design markings and isn't editable but offers a look at the email appearance.


## 


## Attachments


Files can be attached to the email from the library of Documents uploaded via the Settings menu, financial Statements, or you can select a file from your computer using the Choose File button.


## 


## Previewing and Sending


You can use the Preview button to have UltraCamp generate the email for review. This will also display a summary section where you can edit some of the basic message settings if necessary. Click the View link to look at the email itself.


* **Send Email:** Click the Send Email button to queue the email for delivery.



#### 
 Tip


Once you've queued the email, you may review it using the **Account Correspondence icon** in the Current Account menu or by using the Email Correspondence report in the Reports menu. If the email is still in the queue, it can even be deleted to prevent it from sending.

# Storing Groups and Exporting
## Stored Groups


A Stored Groups is a static snapshot of data taken from a report's returned information. Stored Groups have a variety of uses within UltraCamp, ranging from filtering to large scale communication. In addition to saving report return information in the database, UltraCamp can also export returned information in Excel/CSV and PDF formats.    



## Store This Information


When you click the  **Store this information** **icon** on any standard report, you will be bring up the **Create a Stored Group**window. 


* Here you can manage the export of the report's returned information.
* The **Store this information** **icon** usually found in the upper right of a report's return information to store or export data from the report.


## 


## Create a Stored Group


1. **File Name:** By default, UltraCamp will use the report's name as the File Name for the data you are exporting, but you can modify this using the text field to the right.
	* If you are working with multiple stored groups at once, it is a good idea to name them differently for clarity. Be sure to avoid special characters in your stored group name since this can occasionally interfere with the various tools which use stored groups.


2. **Export Type:**This determines what UltraCamp does with the return information.




Stored Groups Excel File PDF

These groups are saved temporarily in UltraCamp 24 hours after midnight of the day on which the group is created. At this point the stored group expires and is wiped from the database.
* **Permanently Save** overrides the expiration.
* Once you've stored your group, you will receive a message in the window stating that the information was stored successfully. You can then safely close the window.



This will allow you to specify a different sort order than the default. The default sort order is the same order as the displayed return information.
* This export type will also permit you to specify exactly which data you wish exported by unchecking the **All Fields** checkbox and then selecting and deselecting which specific items you are looking for.
* Use the **Export** button to initiate the file download. Once the file has been exported, you may close the window.
* When you export to Excel, the file will be in a .csv format for better compatibility with various spreadsheet programs. You will find your exported file in your browsers downloads.



This format will allow you to specify a different sort order from the default as well as choose a Print Template if desired.
* Exporting to a pdf allows you to save and/or print from your computer.
* Custom Print Templates for PDF output can be created by UltraCamp programmers and attached to a specific standard report.
* UltraCamp will display the pdf in the popup window where you can download and save or print the exported file. You may then close the window.





#### 
Tip


You can also export to Excel using the **Quick Export**link at the top right of your return information. When Quick Exporting, your spreadsheet program may warn that the file extension does not match the format of the file. This is due to the way the file is auto-generated. If you receive this alert, click the option to open the file anyway. You can then re-save the file with the correct extension.



 


3. **Visible to All Users:** By checking this box, other administrators with access to reports can use this stored group. Otherwise, it is visible only to you.
4. **Permanently Save:**Prevents the stored group from being automatically removed after its expiration.


* + The resulting stored group can only be deleted manually using the **Manage link** in the Tools menu.



#### 
Tip


Clicking **Store this information**in a custom report does not bring up the same interface. Instead, this link stores the report data directly in the database, using the custom report's name as the File Name for the stored group.

# Scheduling Lodging
With [Facility Templates](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7228644689300) created, you can schedule lodging to sessions in order to allow participants to be assigned to a specific facility. Depending on the individual session settings, participants may or may not be able to select their own lodging.


 


## Session Lodging Groups (Step 1)


Before you can assign individuals to a specific facility, you will need to create a Lodging Group and associate it with one or more sessions. A lodging group will contain multiple cabins or units which are added at a later stage in the setup process. This is the first step in scheduling Lodging.    


**To create or edit Lodging Groups:**


1. 1. Go to the Scheduling menu.
	2. Expand the Lodging section.
	3. Click on [Session Lodging Groups.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Scheduling/sessionlodgingGroupsList.aspx)


 


## Create a New Lodging Group


1. 1. Click the **Create a New Lodging Group.**
	2. Enter a **Lodging Group Name**. This name will be used for reporting and management purposes but is not visible to the public.
	3. Select a **Begin Date** and an **End Date** which includes the date range of your desired session or sessions.
	4. Check Enable Holds *(optional)* if you are permitting clients to select their own lodging. This will make sure their lodging assignment is not taken by another as they proceed through the registration process.
	5. If you enable holds, you can set the **Hold Time** in minutes to determine how long a clients selection is held for them as they move through the registration process. Once they check out, their lodging assignment is locked in.
	6. A Lodging Group may have **Age / Grade Restrictions** enabled to limit who can be assigned to which facilities. Use the dropdown menu to indicate age or grade restrictions if you wish to use this feature.
	7. Click the **Select Sessions** button to choose which sessions this Lodging Group applies to. Only sessions which fit within the specified Begin and End Dates are eligible.
	8. Click the **Save button** to save your work to your database.



#### 
 Tip


A lodging group is not the same as a cabin or individual unit. Typically, a Lodging group reflects a time frame and is named something like "Junior 1" or "Week 1."



 


## Session Lodging Units (Step 2)


Facilities must be attached to a lodging group before individuals can select or be assigned to them. The Lodging Units page allows you to attach facilities to a specific lodging group as well as determine the behavior settings for that facility within that lodging group. This is the second step in scheduling lodging. 


1. 1. Go to the Scheduling menu.
	2. Expand the Lodging section.
	3. Click the [Session Lodging Units link](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Scheduling/sessionlodgingUnits.aspx).


 


## Scheduling Lodging Units


1. 1. Select your **Lodging Group** from the dropdown menu.
	2. To add a facility to the lodging group from the list of available facilities, you must **check** the box to the left of the facility name.
	3. Indicate which **Gender** will be assigned to this facility using the dropdown menu. If there are no gender restrictions, choose Family.
	4. The **Capacity** can be changed from the default using the field to the right.
	5. A per person fee can be added to those assigned a specific facility. This is done by adjusting the **Rate**
	6. The **Group / Identifier** will be displayed along with the facility name in reports. It is typically used to record the name of a staff member assigned to the designated facility, but any text can be entered here.
	7. By default, UltraCamp will display facilities in alpha-numeric order. You can override this sort order using the **Display Rank** Lower numbers will display before higher numbers.
	8. Click the **Save** button to save your changes.





 


## Step 3: Lodging Assignments


Once your Lodging Groups are created and connected and your Lodging Units are added, you may assign individuals to lodging administratively. The fastest way to do this is through the Lodging Assignments tool.  


1. 1. In the Scheduling menu.
	2. Expand the Lodging section.
	3. Click the [Lodging Assignments.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Assignments/sessionlodgingAssignments.aspx)
	4. Select your **Lodging Group** from the dropdown menu.
	5. Select the **Gender**of the lodging units to which you wish to assign individuals. If your lodging units do not have gender restrictions, select All.
	6. Indicate which **Display Information** you wish shown alongside each attendee's session, name, and gender.
		* Cabin mate or bunk mate requests are often handled as a Session Custom Question. If this is the case for your organization, checking this box will allow you review this information when assigning individuals to lodging.
	7. Click the **Search** button to return a list of Unassigned Participants along with Available Lodging Units.



  
  



## Unassigned Participants


The Unassigned Participants section will display any attendees from the Lodging Group's sessions that aren't currently assigned to a facility.


**To assign these participants to a facility:**


1. Check the box next to one or more names.
2. Click the radio button next to the desired Facility.
3. Click the button to **Assign to Selected Cabin** button to complete the process.


 


## Available Lodging Units


Each facility that has been added as a Lodging Unit appears along with its designated Gender and total Enrollment. Click a facility to expand it and view those who are assigned to that facility.


**To remove someone from their currently assigned facility:**


1. Check the box to the left of their name.
2. Click the Remove Assignments button. This will shift the selected participant(s) back to the Unassigned Participants section.
# Setting your Registration Page Order
You can control the order of what your clients encounter during the registration process. This is done through the Registration Page Order. There are two ways of setting up a Registration Page Order:


* Use the Session Editing Wizard to make the process unique to each session.
* Use a Page Order Template to make the process consistent across multiple sessions.


It is possible to use a combination of these two approaches, but only if you use separate Session Templates for each approach.


## 


## Page Order Template


A page order template sets up a consistent registration process for one or more Session Templates. It then automatically controls the registration process of all sessions scheduled using this template (or templates).


 


#### Step 1: Create a Page Order Template


**To create a Page Order Template, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the **Session Templates** section.
	2. Click [Page Order Templates.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/pageOrderMastersList.aspx)
	3. Click **Create a New Template.**
	4. Enter a **Name** for this template (it will only be visible to admins).
	5. Arrange the page blocks by clicking and dragging the Registration Process section on the right.
	6. Click the **Save** button at the bottom.


You now need to attach this Page Order Template to a Session Template in order for it to have any effect. You can return and edit your Page Order Template at any time by clicking on the template or the icon to the right of it.


 


#### Step 2: Connect a Page Order Template to a Session Template


**To connect your Page Order Template to a Session Template, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the **Session Templates** section.
	2. Click [Session Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/sessiontemplates.aspx).
	3. Click the edit icon (or create a new Session Template).
	4. In the wizard proceed to the **Registration Information** page.
	5. In the dropdown menu for **Page Order Master**, choose the appropriate template.
	6. Click the **Complete** button to save your changes.


You can now exit the wizard. All sessions that are created using this session template will use the page order you have connected to it. A single Page Order Template can be connected to multiple session templates by repeating Step 2 for each desired Session Template.


## 


## Session Editing Wizard - Registration Page Order


Use the Registration Page Order page in the Session Editing wizard when the session does *not* have a Page Order Template connected. This will give you the most flexibility in setting your page order per session, but it is more work if you don't use UltraCamp's default order.


**To set your Registration Page Order on a session, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Open the **Session Editing** wizard for the session you wish to adjust.
		* From the [**Summary of Sessions**](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/scheduling/sessions.aspx) page, click the edit icon to the right of the desired session.
		* Click the My Sessions menu and then click the edit icon to the right of the desired session.
	2. In the wizard, proceed to the **Registration Page Order** page in the **Basic Settings** section.
	3. Arrange the page blocks by clicking and dragging the Registration Process section on the right.
	4. Click the **Complete** button at the bottom.


This will save your page order for *this session only* and will not impact other sessions.


 



#### 
 Tip


You can use the **Copy Session Settings** tool to copy the Registration Page Order to other sessions that don't have a Page Order Template attached.


 



## 


## Arranging the Page Order


Whether you are using a Page Order Template or the Session Editing Wizard, you will need to arrange the page blocks to adjust the order from UltraCamp's default.


The Page Order tool is divided into three sections:


* **Excluded Pages** - This is for UltraCamp standard pages that you don't want to appear during registration.
* **Custom Online Forms** - These are the online forms you've created to collect custom information from your clients.
* **Registration Process** - This represents your client experience during registration. The blocks at the top will be the first items clients encounter after choosing a reservation. Items at the bottom will be later in registration prior to checkout (which is standardized).


You can adjust these items by clicking on a block and dragging it to the desired place.


 





 


 

# Task Templates
## How Task Templates Work


* Task Templates are used to track events which are not part of the registration process.
* They can be manually added or automatically added by the completion of a reservation.
* Once added to an account, they can trigger reminder emails, be manually marked complete, or be automatically marked complete by the submission of a document.



#### 
 Note


The due date of a task can trigger a Task Reminder Email. This email can be a custom message or you can use UltraCamp's default Task Reminder Email. Below you will find the text for the default reminder email.

1. 1. **In the Health menu:**
		1. Expand the Recording section.
		2. Select Record Dispensed Medications.
		3. On the resulting page, type the account number or part of the name in the Select the Account field.
		4. Once you've identified the correct account, Select the person for whom you wish to dispense medications from the dropdown menu.
		5. Click the Next button.
	2. **Open the appropriate account:**
		1. Click on the desired individual under Account Members.
		2. Expand the Medications menu on the Person Detail page.
		3. Click the Administer Meds link.

In the resulting window, each medication scheduled to be administered for the current day will display under its allotted time slot. Its name, route, and dosage display along with any comments entered when the medication was entered in the system.


* **Dispensed or Not Dispensed:** Each medication can be marked as Dispensed or Not Dispensed as appropriate.
* **Dosage:** If the dosage delivered varies from the default amount, you can also adjust the Dosage using the text field to the right.
* **Actual Date Given:** By default, UltraCamp uses the current date and time to record when a medication was dispensed. However, you can indicate a different dispense time using the Actual Date Given field. Both the calendar icon and the clock icon can be used to select a date and time other than the current time. UltraCamp will record the time of the log entry but indicate the alternate dispense time as well.
* **Reason/Comments:** Comments can be recorded in the Reason/Comments field.

# Working in Test Mode
Initial training and setup in UltraCamp starts with your database in test mode. This allows you to set up, test and get comfortable with the features of your account before going live. Any reservations made while in test mode will not incur any reservation fees. 


A banner at the top of the database will indicate that your organization is in test mode. This is removed once the database goes live





 


## Payments in Test Mode


* Any reservations made from the public side do not incur UltraCamp fees.
* Credit card payments made **at the time of checkout** will not go through.



#### 
 Note


Scheduled payments made with credit card or ACH (such as payment plans), and payments made outside the checkout process **WILL** go through and processing charges will apply.


When in test mode, we recommend that you use the Check/Cash payment options or saving without payment. This allows you to test the reservation process and confirmation email without incurring actual charges.



 


## Exiting Test Mode


When your organization is ready to exit test mode and go live, please call or submit a support ticket. Our support staff will be happy to help you. Our offices are open for normal support between **9 am and 5 pm EST**. Our toll free number is: **(888) 791-2080.**


  
  



  
  



  
  


# Account Roles
There are two critical Account Roles in UltraCamp:


* **Primary Contact**
* **Secondary Contact**


Additional roles can be added, but they will only find function in reporting and identification and are therefore optional.


The **Primary Contact** is considered the main account holder. Their contact information will be the default for the account, and all account correspondence will be directed to their information. Their name will display as the signature on all electronically signed forms. They will automatically be listed as an authorized pickup.


The **Secondary Contact** can be cc'd on all account correspondence and can be listed as an authorized pickup, but these must be opted into. Your organization may allow the Secondary Contact to reset the account login information, but this is optional.


 


## Optional Account Roles


Some organizations find additional labels useful. For example, the labels "parent" or "guardian" might clarify who the Primary Contact is in relation to the children on the account. When adding additional Account Roles, consider whether this role should be select-able only by Adults or only by Children. Here are some example optional Account Roles:


* Parent - should be visible only to Adults on the account
* Sibling of Child with Diagnosis - typically only visible to Children on the account
* Alumni - typically visible to Everyone

# Grade Collection and Promotion
UltraCamp can collect grade information about an individual and promote them automatically to the next level at a designated month in the year. This grade level can be used to determine eligibility for programs, activities, and options.


 


## Grade Promotion


On the first day of the specified month, UltraCamp will automatically promote an individual to the next grade level. Choosing this month is important if eligibility for your programs is based on grade.


* If eligibility is based on the grade a child just completed or is in currently, the promotion month should be AFTER the session ends
* If eligibility is based on the grade a child is going into, the promotion should be BEFORE the session starts.


 


## Examples of Grade Setup


* **Example A:** Ruff Writing Camp starts their program mid-June and runs through August. A camper is placed based on the grade they just finished in the previous school year. *The grade promotion month should be set to September for Ruff Writing Camp.*
* **Example B:** Bird Camp runs July through most of August. Each week is restricted to a particular grade range based on the child's grade in the Fall. *The grade promotion month for Bird Camp could be either June or July.*
* **Example C:** Graham Jones School runs a summer STEM program starting in June in addition to aftercare and extended learning during the school year. Eligibility for their summer STEM program is based on the grade the child is going into in the Fall, but their school-year program is based on the grade the child is actually in. *The grade promotion month should be set to June for Graham Jones School.*


 


## Grade Collection FAQ


**Can I add new grade levels or change the terminology from the default Kindergarten through College?**


Yes. By entering a ticket, you can request the addition of new grade levels below grade 13. You can also request that the default grade terminology be changed. A common request is the addition of a Pre-K below Kindergarten. Just be sure to provide detailed specifics in your ticket regarding what you want added or changed.


 


**Can I change the default question from "Grade Entering in Fall of [Current Year]"?**


No. It is important that parents answer this question as it is written in order for the calculation for promotion and eligibility to function properly.


 


**Why is the Grade Level different on a child's biographical information than it is on this report?**


The biographical page on an account always shows the current grade. Reports in UltraCamp can show the current grade or the grade a child is in during the selected session or date range, depending on the report. Check your report details to see which grade is being displayed.

# Facility Template Setup for Retreats
Facility Templates are used to manage facilities for the Retreat / Conference module and also lodging for sessions. These templates are re-usable from season to season and event to event to make scheduling and reservations faster and easier. Before you can create a facility template, you will first need to create Facility Categories.


 


## Finding Facility Categories


All facilities must be assigned to a category. Categories help organize your facilities as well as in your reporting on the facilities themselves.    


**To create or edit a Facility Category:**


1. 1. Go to the Settings menu.
	2. Expand the Facility Templates.
	3. Select [Facility Categories.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/FacilityCategoriesList.aspx)


 


## Creating a New Facility Category


1. 1. Click the **Create a New Facility Category.**
	2. Enter a **Category Name.** This can be anything from "Cabins" to "Meals" to "Eagle Lodge." Keep in mind that this is a heading and not the actual facility an individual or group will be assigned to.
	3. **Category Description** is optional and does not appear to the public.
	4. Select an **allocation account** *(optional)*using the dropdown menu. Once an allocation account is selected, all revenue gained from this facility category will apply to the specified account (unless overridden on the facility itself).
	5. Use the **Category Type** menu to indicate whether this is a "Facility," "Lodging," or "Meal" type facility. This feature is particularly useful when using the Retreat Center.
	6. By default, the Active box is checked. Uncheck this box only if you wish to deactivate the facility category.
	7. Use the **Save Category** button to save your category and any changes you have made.


 


## Editing an Existing Category


Existing Facility Categories will be listed alphabetically along with their description, Allocation Account number, and Facility Type. 


* To edit a facility category by clicking the **pencil or edit icon** to the right.
* Click the **X or delete** icon to disable the facility category.





 


## Finding Facility Templates


Facility Templates are the actual groups, activities, and/or items to which individuals are assigned. This can be done either through when making a retreat reservation (or through Lodging Assignments for sessions).    


**To create or edit Facility Templates:** 


1. 1. Go to the Settings menu.
	2. Expand the Facility Templates.
	3. Click the [Facility Templates link.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/FacilitiesList.aspx)


 


## Creating a New Facility or Editing an Existing One


To create a new facility, click the button at the top of the page. If you are editing an existing facility, click on it or the edit icon to the right. You can then address the following settings:


1. 1. The **Facility Name** will be visible to the public in retreat reservation correspondence and in your reports. (It also shows to the public during session registration if they are prompted to select their own lodging.)
	2. You must select a **Facility Category** from the dropdown menu.
	3. **Facility Description** *(optional)* shows to clients who are permitted to select their own lodging in the registration process.
	4. The **Capacity** indicates the default number of individuals who can occupy or use this facility at a given time. This field is required but can be overridden elsewhere.
	5. **Allocation account** *(optional)*Select using the dropdown menu. Once an allocation account is selected, all revenue gained from this facility will apply to the specified account. If set here, the allocation account will override allocation account selections on the Facility Category and/or Session level.
	6. Check the **Active box**to set this facility for active use on retreat reservations (or sessions).


While this is all that is necessary for creating facilities used with sessions, for Retreat Module setup you'll need to address the next section as well.


#### Retreat / Conference Center Reservation Defaults:


The retreat defaults will impact how your facility behaves when added to a retreat reservation. All these settings are *optional,* but the Price Definitions are necessary if you wish to bill for this item.


1. 1. Check the box for **Occurs Daily** if this facility is booked for a specific, recurring time throughout the retreat reservation. This works particularly well for things like meals or daily instructors.
	2. If you checked the box for "Occurs Daily," Enter the daily **Start Time** and **End Time** to indicate when this item is available/occurring.
	3. Text entered in the **Operating Hours** field will show to admins when reviewing this facility template.
	4. Check the box if you want to **Add total reservation participants as default quantity** when reserving this item. This is useful if participants count toward this facility's capacity or if you charge per person.
	5. Check the **Price Definitions** that should apply to this facility. The selected price definitions can be selected when creating a retreat reservation.
	6. Click **Save Facility** button to upload your changes to the database.
# Email Templates
If you find yourself repeatedly sending the same email message--or a very similar email message--an email template can save you a lot of time. For ease of use and quick retrieval, Email Templates store:


* + Your Email Subject Line
	+ The Marketing status of your email
	+ The Body of your Email (including formatting and personalization fields)
	+ Any pre-selected Attachments


To find where to create and edit email templates directly, take the following steps:


1. 1. Go to the Settings menu and expand the Communication section.
	2. Click [Email Templates.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/EmailTemplatesList.aspx)


## Create an Email Template


To create an email template you will need to enter information that will be used whenever you send a message using this template. When manually sending a message, you'll be able to tweak and adjust the settings and information you enter now. However, all automatic messaging using this template will only use what you input here:


#### Email Template Content


* Enter your **Template Name**. This will be used for admin purposes only and not be visible to the public.
* Enter the **Email Subject Line**. This will appear to the recipient in any email correspondence sent using this template.
* Check the **Is Marketing** box if this template is not directly related to existing registrations or information related to an existing reservation. This puts the required "Unsubscribe" link into the email message.
* Fill out the body of the email with your message. You can use the formatting and content icons as well as the dropdown menus to manage how this message will appear to your clients.
	+ You can switch between **Design**, **HTML** and **Preview** modes to help prepare your message
	+ Use the **Insert Personalization Fields** dropdown to add data directly from UltraCamp into your message. For example, selecting the "primary\_nameFirst" will insert the appropriate first name of the primary contact into each recipient's email.
	+ Use the **Links into UltraCamp** dropdown to add links to specific pages or turn text into a redirect to a desired page.



#### 
 Tip


If you don't see a personalization field you wish to use in your template, try running a report that contains that field. Save that report as a [**stored group**](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7259298092436) and then use the [Email a stored group tool](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/correspondence/email.aspx) to create your Email Template.


If you are creating a custom Email Template for a **Retreat Reservation**, try using the link to *Email Invoice* on the Retreat Reservation Detail page. This will offer you a complete list of available personalization fields for Retreat Reservations, and you can use the **Save as new template** link in the "Email Templates" section to store your template information.



#### 


#### Attachments


While we recommend including links to documents rather than attaching files, sometimes a file is more desirable.


To attach one or more files, check the box next to the name.


* + **Documents** are files that have been uploaded to your Document Center.
	+ **Auto-filled Documents** are custom pdf outputs.
	+ **Statements** are the financial activity record for an account and separated by season.


#### 


#### Save your Template


You can save your progress by clicking the **Save** button at the bottom of the page. This can be done any time *after* inputting a Template Name.


 



#### 
 Tip


You can also create an email template while composing a specific email message in the [email tool](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/correspondence/email.aspx). Just click the **Save as new template** link in the "Email Templates" section at the top. You'll be prompted to give the template a name and save it.

# Manage Sponsorship Codes
Sponsorship codes provide a clean method of tracking the payment of one account for the fees of another.  Sponsorship codes are enabled in the My Settings wizard and can be set up to be purchased by the public or controlled internally. 


## 
Creating Sponsorship Codes


**To create a new Sponsorship code, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Select the **Account** and click **View Financial History**
	2. Expand **Additional Actions** and select **Management Sponsorship Codes**
	3. Click **Create a new sponsorship code**
	4. Use the UltraCamp generated **Sponsorship Code**or create your own
		* Once a Sponsorship code is saved, the redemption code cannot be edited.
	5. Enter an **Expiration Date**for when this code can no longer be claimed
		* We recommend the end date of your season
	6. Enter a **Sponsorship Cap** amount (the overall budget for this code)
	7. [Optional] Check the **Allow Public to Claim** checkbox to let a public user enter the code during registration to claim it.
	8. The **Preset Sponsorship Value**is the default value the sponsorship code.
		* If it is set to 0, whoever claims the sponsorship will be prompted to enter a sponsorship amount.
	9. Enter the amount of times it may be claimed.
		* Sponsorship codes can be set to only permit a certain number of claims before shutting off. This is generally applicable only to publicly claimed codes.
		* Administrators can override these limits. We recommend making this a minimum of 1 claim per reservation.


* + If automated discounts may reduce the cost of a session, you can check the box to set this code to reduce the amount of the sponsorship by the same amount as the discount.  This will result in the sponsor account having to pay less for the individual they are sponsoring.
	+ By Default, **Store monies are not covered by this sponsorship code** or any sponsorship code.  If your organization is using the Legacy camp store setup, you can uncheck this box to override this session and allow Legacy store monies to be covered by this code.  Point of sale store monies are never covered by a sponsorship code.


  
  



## Managing an Existing Sponsorship


Once a sponsorship is created, it will be listed on the Finance Detail page.  Click the View icon next to the code to manage it.


### 
Sponsorship Code Detail


* The sponsorship code detail page displays a **Summary** of the code's information.  It also lists each individual **Claim** made using the code.
* To change the code's settings, click the **Edit this Code.**
* Click the **Print Summary / Invoice** to generate a pdf summary of the code.  This pdf can be downloaded or printed and used as an invoice.




# Custom Question Templates
Custom Question Templates control the behavior and data collection of custom questions. Once created, they need to be scheduled somewhere in order to be seen and addressed by clients. This is most often done through [Custom Online Forms](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7231482555284), but it can also be done by [scheduling the question](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7232125986836) to a specific page.   


**To make or edit Custom Question Templates:**


1. 1. In the **Settings** menu, expand the **Custom Questions** section.
	2. Click [Custom Question Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/CustomQuestionsList.aspx).


Here you can create new questions or review and edit existing ones. If a Custom Question Template is attached to an online form, it can also be edited on the Layout page of the My Forms wizard.

## 
Creating and Editing Custom Question Templates


To create or edit a custom question, take the following steps:


1. 1. Click **Create a new custom question** or click the **edit** icon to the right of an existing one.
	2. Enter the **Question Name**.
	3. Enter the **Question Asked**.
	4. Designate the desired question settings.
	5. Click the **Save Question button**.


Once you save your question, it will be displayed alpha-numerically in the list of existing custom questions.


You can delete or disable an existing question by clicking the X to the right of the listed question.


 


## Custom Question Settings and Details


Below is a detailed breakdown of each of the settings found on a Custom Question Template:





 


#### Question Name


The **Question Name** is used for identifying the question in reporting and in building forms. 


Each question should have a unique question name. Clients rarely see the question name, but it does show up as the default header for columns in the report builder.


 


#### Question Asked


The **Question Asked** is the question prompt your client will see (if the question is public).



#### 
 Note


It is not recommended to use HTML in a Custom Question template. It can interfere with printing and retrieving question answers when reporting.



 


#### Question Type


The **Question Type** adjusts the way the question presents and collects information. Indicate the Question Type by selecting an option from the dropdown.


* + **Text box Single Line:** Questions provide a single line field for clients to enter a text answer very much like the Question Name field on this page.
	+ **Text box Multiple Line:** Questions provide a text field for clients to enter a larger amount of text. The Question Asked field on this page is an example of a Multiple Line question.
	+ **Checkbox:** A Checkbox question places a single checkbox next to the Question Asked. Clients answer this question by either checking the box or not checking the box.
	+ **Checkbox List - Vertical Display:** Question type presents a series of answer options with checkboxes in a vertical list. Clients may select one or more or none of the options.
	+ **Checkbox List - Horizontal Display:** Question type presents a series of answer options with checkboxes horizontally and in columns if there are enough answer options. Clients may select one or more or none of the options.
	+ **Radio button List - Horizontal Display:** Question also presents a series of answer options horizontally and in columns if there are enough answer options. However, in this case the client may only select only one answer option.
	+ **Radio button List - Vertical Display:** Question presents its answer options one above the next. The client may only select one answer option.



#### 
 Tip


Custom Questions can be used to force clients to agree to specified terms or conditions. A Radio button Question Type with a single answer option that is required is a good way to make this happen.



* + **Dropdown List:** Displays answer options in a dropdown menu. Clients can select one answer option. The Question Type on this page is an example of a dropdown List.
	+ **Select List:** features a scrolling series of answer options. Clients usually select one answer but may use the Ctrl or Shift key to select multiple answer options at once.


#### 


#### Number of Columns:


Radio button and checkbox list question types can have their answer options displayed in a **Number of Columns**.


Use the dropdown menu to indicate how many columns in which to display the provided answer options.


 


#### Layout Type:


The question and its answer field/options can be arranged visually on the page using a **Layout Type**. 


The question can be displayed to the left with its answer field or options to the right, or the question can be displayed above the answer field or options.


 


#### Answer Options


This only shows when a question type indicates the client should choose from one or more responses provided for them, use the Answer Options field to create these responses. If you are not using a text box question type or the simple checkbox question type, you must enter at least one answer option.


* + Answer options should be typed in a comma separated list. Each comma indicates a new Answer Option.
	+ Do not use the Enter key (or hard return) when entering answers.


 


#### Answer Validation


This optional setting is designed only for text box question types. It verifies that the client's answer is either in numeric or date format. 


We recommend this feature be used sparingly if it is used at all.


 


#### Display


A custom question's display restricts who sees that question once it has been scheduled. 


* + Check the box to display on the **Public Side** to permit clients to address the question.
	+ Check the box to display on the **Admin Side** to show this question to admin users.
	+ If the box for **Adults** is checked, this question can apply to biographical information and reservations for individuals identified as adults in the system. If this box is not checked, this question will display for children and related reservations.


 


#### Require


Requiring a question, prevents the user from proceeding past this question without making a response--either an answer option must be selected or one must be typed in. 


* *In most scenarios, a question should only be required only on the Public Side, if it is required at all.*
* There are some scenarios where requiring a question be answered on the Admin Side can be a useful tool to make sure that your team members don't omit information in a registration or form.


 


#### Save Question


When creating or editing a custom question master, remember to click the Save Question button to upload any changes to your database. 


Whenever a question is saved, all instances of that question are also automatically updated throughout your database.


 



#### 
 Note


Changing a question after clients have already answered does not immediately change their answer, which is stored in a special table in the database. The next time clients see that question, however, they will be prompted to use the new answer settings and will write over their old answer.



 

# Option Aggregates 
Option Aggregates are a tool that lets you compare and limit the availability of two or more options. Through option aggregates, you can even limit across sessions.


**To find where to manage option aggregates, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Go to the **Scheduling** menu and expand the **Advanced Items** section.
	2. Click [Option Aggregates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Scheduling/OptionAggregateList.aspx).


Here you'll be able to create new Option Aggregates and review or edit existing ones.


 


## Creating an Option Aggregate


**To create an option aggregate, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Click the button to **Create an Option Aggregate**.
	2. Enter a name for the **Option Aggregate** (this will be visible only to admins).
	3. Enter the **Maximum Total** for the combined availability of the options.
	4. Click the **Save Aggregate** button.


You will be returned to the list of existing aggregates. In order to complete setup, you will need to edit the option aggregate you just created.


 


## Editing an Option Aggregate


**To edit an option aggregate, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Click the option aggregate you wish to manage or the edit icon to the right.
	2. [Optional] You can adjust the **Name** or the **Maximum Total** and click **Update Aggregate**, but this will return you to the list.
	3. In the **Select a Session** dropdown, choose the session you wish to work with.
	4. Check the box next to any option you wish to count toward the Maximum Total.
	5. Click the **Add to Aggregate** button.


Once an option has been added to the Aggregate, it will be displayed in the **Current Aggregate Members** section. You can remove options from the aggregate by clicking the Remove link to the right.


You may add other options to this aggregate--including options from other sessions--by repeating steps 3-5. UltraCamp will limit the availability of all added options so that the combination of enrollment or selection will not surpass the Maximum Total specified on the aggregate.


 


## Example Aggregates


The following examples may provide some guidance as you plan your option aggregates.


 


#### Example 1: Capping an Option across Multiple Sessions


Anton offers aftercare each week. He runs multiple sessions for different age groups in that week but the aftercare facility is limited in size. To prevent overfilling aftercare, he creates an Option Aggregate for each week with the following settings:


* + **Name:** Week 1 Aftercare
	+ **Maximum Total:**  25
	+ **Current Aggregate Members:**
		- Session: Week 1 Younglings, Option: Aftercare, Total: 0/25
		- Session: Week 1 Trainees, Option: Aftercare, Total: 0/25
		- Session: Week 1 Acolytes, Option: Aftercare, Total: 0/15


This setup will prevent Aftercare from having more than 25 total people during week 1. A new aggregate mirroring this would need to be set up for each of Anton's weeks.


 


#### Example 2: Limiting Options within a single session


Rivke has a limited number of logo hats. These can be purchased individually or are included with camp souvenir packets. To make sure that she doesn't end up sending souvenir packets without hats, she sets up an Option Aggregate for her summer sessions with the following settings:


* + **Name:** Hats for Summer 2023
	+ **Maximum Total:** 200 hats
	+ **Current Aggregate Members:**
		- Session: Week 1, Option: Logo Hat, Total: 0/100
		- Session: Week 1, Option: Silver Packet, Total: 0/100
		- Session: Week 1, Option: Gold Packet, Total: 0/100
		- Session: Week 2, Option: Logo Hat, Total: 0/100
		- Session: Week 2, Option: Silver Packet, Total: 0/100
		- Session: Week 2, Option: Gold Packet, Total: 0/100
		- Session: Week 3, Option: Logo Hat, Total: 0/100
		- Session: Week 3, Option: Silver Packet, Total: 0/100
		- Session: Week 3, Option: Gold Packet, Total: 0/100


If Rivke offered more than 3 weeks of camp, she would need to also add those weeks to the aggregate. This aggregate will block selection of any of the options listed as aggregate members once the Maximum Total of 200 has been reached.


 


## Reading the Option Aggregate Summary Pages


The Option Aggregate lists contain information that can be useful for managing your aggregates. Below is a description of each summary page associated with Option Aggregates:


 


#### Reading the Current Session Option Aggregates Page


The **Current Session Option Aggregates** section has four columns:


* + The **Aggregate Name** lists each created aggregate.
	+ The **Members** column displays how many options are being compared.
	+ The **Total** column displays current enrollment / Maximum Total.
	+ The edit icon to the right of each aggregate will let you adjust its settings.


A quick look at this page will give you an overview of your capacity and numbers by aggregate.


 


#### Reading the Current Aggregate Members section


The Current Aggregate Members section displays all options that are being compared to the Maximum Total. It has five columns of information focused around the options that have been added.


* + The first column lists the **Session** the option is attached to.
	+ The **Category** column identifies the Option Category.
	+ The **Option** is listed by name.
	+ The **Total** column lists enrolled / availability for this specific instance of the option.


You can review this list to easily review session option availability within a given aggregate.

# Session Prerequisites
Prerequisites can be used to restrict who can register for a specific session. If someone selects a session with a prerequisite but does not mean its requirements, they will not be able to complete the registration. This advanced setting is managed in the Session Editing wizard.


 


## Creating a Prerequisite


To create a prerequisite, take the following steps:


1. 1. Open the Session Editing wizard for the desired session.
	2. Proceed to the Prerequisites page in the Advanced Settings section of the wizard.
	3. Click the Add a New Prerequisite link.
	4. Follow the prompts to create the prerequisite.


 


## Prerequisite Settings


There are several ways to customize a prerequisite. The following prompts will be shown and determine how the prerequisite behaves: 


* **If this prerequisite is met, should all other prerequisites for this item be disregarded?**
	+ Select **No**if you are planning on using multiple prerequisites for this session and someone must meet them all in order to be eligible. Otherwise, select **Yes**.
* **Indicate if this prerequisite is a Template or Scheduled Item.**
	+ Choose **Scheduled Item** if a specific Session, Option, or Activity will determine eligibility.
	+ Choose **Master** if any item scheduled from a designated template will qualify (this is broader and can reach across seasons).
* **Select if this prerequisite is a Session, Option or Activity.**
	+ Choose Session, Option, or Activity as appropriate.


Depending on your selections, you'll be prompted to choose the specific item or items that determine eligibility (starting with the season if you've chosen a Scheduled Item).


* **Custom Message**
	+ UltraCamp will automatically display an ineligibility message for those who don't qualify. It will identify the missing prerequisite and include a link to register for that item.
	+ Entering a **Custom Message** will replace the default message text.
# Documents
By uploading a document in pdf format to UltraCamp, you can make that document easily accessible to clients as an attachment, a download link or through the document center in their account.    


**To upload a document or edit a pre-existing document:**


1. 1. Open the **Settings** menu and click on **Communication**.
	2. Select the [**Document Manageme**nt link.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/Documents.aspx)
	3. Click the button to Upload a new document or choose an existing document to edit listed under Manage Existing Documents.


## 
Basic Information


* **Document Name:** The Document Name will be used as this pdf's label throughout UltraCamp and will be visible to your clients if this document is made accessible to them.
* **Category:** If you have a large number of posted documents, you may want to give them a Category to make it easier for clients to locate the document they are looking for. You can select an existing category from the dropdown menu or you can type a new one in the field below. This is optional, however, and can be skipped.
* **Upload File:** Clicking in the File field or the Choose file button will bring up a popup window where you can search your local hard drive and select the pdf you wish to upload.
* **View Current Document:** Once you've saved your document in the database, a link will appear to View Current Document. Clicking this link will bring up the pdf in a new window, new tab or download, depending on your browser settings.
* **Display In Document Center:** If you wish clients to be able to access a pdf directly, check the box to Display In Document Center. Leaving this box unchecked will restrict access to those who receive the pdf as an attachment or link in an email.
* **Enabled:** By default, a document is Enabled . When you no longer wish to use a document but would like to preserve for reference or perhaps future use, you can uncheck this box to hide it both from public view and on the list of existing documents. Disabled forms can be viewed by unchecking the box to Only display enabled documents at the top right of the list of existing documents.


## 
Confirmation


* **Attach as PDF or Provide Link**: When documents are included with a confirmation email, they can either Attach as a PDF or be included as a Link Only in the email itself. Use the dropdown menu to indicate which approach you would prefer for this document.
* **Include Order:** When UltraCamp generates the pdf attachment, it can blend multiple pdfs into one. Use the Include Order to override the alphanumeric defaults and determine which documents appear first. Smaller numbers will appear before larger numbers.
* **Group File Name:**UltraCamp combines documents with the same Group File Name into a single pdf. Documents attached without a Group File Name will be combined with the confirmation receipt.



#### 
 Tip


If you wish to attach a document as it's own PDF attachment, give the document a unique Group File Name. This also makes the attachment stand out more in the confirmation email.



## 
Document Processing


Document processing allows clients to download a barcoded pdf, print it out, and return it via fax, email, or direct upload to UltraCamp where it is uploaded to their account. Form processing works on documents attached to a confirmation email as well as documents downloaded from the Document Center.


There are two main ways to process documents: E-Fax/Email or Allow Public Upload.


### 


### Document Processing Type (E-Fax/Email)


From the dropdown menu, you may indicate how you'd like this document to connect:


* **Per Person:** Documents attach to an individual account member.
* **Per Account:** Documents attach to an account and can be found on the Primary Contact's biographical page.
* **Imprint Barcode for Processing:** To enable Document Processing, you will need to enable Imprint Barcode For Processing.
* **Form-Fill Binding:**If your document is a form-fillable pdf, it is possible to connect a custom online form to print to this pdf. This is done through the creation of a Form Fill Binding.
	+ Form Fill Bindings must be created by an UltraCamp team member, but once this is done, this dropdown menu is used to make sure that attached pdfs pull the data from the completed online form.



#### 
 Note


Always consult an UltraCamp Support Team Member before changing or adjusting a Form Fill Binding.



 


* **Expiration Type:**A document's expiration status indicates whether it is up to date or not. You may use the Expiration Type dropdown menu to determine when UltraCamp identifies a document as being out of date.
	+ A document that **Never Expires** is always considered complete and up to date once it has been uploaded or processed.
	+ A document that **Expires** each season will be marked out of date or "Incomplete" at the end of the season in which it is uploaded.


### 


### Allow Public Upload


* If this document is something your clients should print out, complete, and then upload to UC for storage and/or reporting, you can set it to Allow Public Upload.
* This will enable the upload page where clients can select a file from their computer and upload it to the database. UltraCamp will add that file to the Uploads queue for approval by you, at which point it will be saved to the account or individual.
* Select **Allow Public Upload** and click **Save Document.**



#### 
 Tip


Use the Barcode settings in conjunction with the Allow Public Upload function to have UltraCamp pre-identify documents added to the upload queue and speed the approval process.



* **Delete Document / Save Document:**Use the buttons at the bottom.


## 
Current Utilization


The Current Utilization section will indicate places where a saved document is attached to a registration item. This will identify if the document is bound to an online form, confirmation master, or individual session confirmation email.

# Manage Discounts on an Account
Through the **Manage Discounts tool**, you can approve, edit, and delete simple discounts as well as have UltraCamp recalculate multi-week discounts. Each session from the current season will be listed on this page. Below each session will be listed the applicable discounts.


  
After a reservation has been made, it may be necessary to adjust discounts on a single account. There are two approaches to adjusting discounts on an account.


**To manage discounts for a single account:**


1. 1. Open the desired account.
	2. Proceed to the Finance Detail page.
	3. Select the desired Season from the dropdown menu on the Finance Detail page.

	2. Click the View icon to the right of the desired reservation
	3. Click the Edit icon next to Discounts in the Fee Detail for the reservation


## 
Simple Discounts


Simple Discounts will display with radio buttons to the left and an amount field to the right. You can adjust the discount amount by editing the dollar amount in the field.


1. 1. Select the **Approved** button to apply the discount amount to the reservation.
	2. Select the **Pending**button to shift the discount to a pending status.
		* Pending discounts show on the account and reports as awaiting administrative approval but don't affect reservation or account balances.
	3. If a discount is Approved or Pending, the **Delete** button will appear. Select this button to remove the discount from the reservation.
	4. Click the **Save Discounts** button in order to save any changes made on this page to simple discounts.


## 
Multi-Week Discounts


Multi-week discounts are automated and therefore cannot have their amounts changed manually. Sometimes, however, a Multi-Week discount may not calculate correctly.  To fix this, try the following:


* At the bottom of the list of discounts and sessions, click the link to **Apply / Recalculate MultiWeek Discounts**.


  
  


# Integrated Point-of-Sale
UltraCamp has a point-of-sale system to simplify the management of your organization's store. 


* In addition to processing traditional retail transactions and enabling inventory control, UltraCamp’s store supports the cashless environment under which most camps operate.
* Money can be deposited at any time to a camper’s store account either on site or online. Those funds immediately become available for use.
* If desired, a history of purchases is visible to parents by logging into their account.
* At the end of a season, left over money in a camper’s account can simply be credited back or transferred as a donation to the camp.


## 


## Point-of-Sale Integration with UltraCamp


UltraCamp and the Point-of-Sale system integrate to make management of monies easier across the two platforms. This video reviews the basics of that integration.



## 


## Using the Register


The main register interface in the Point-of-Sale system is used to process transactions and manage account information. 


* In order to make full of the Register, your screen should be set to a resolution of at least **1024x768** if using Full Screen.
* Using a screen with a smaller resolution may result in the need to zoom in or out.



## 


## Processing a Return


Returns can be processed in the Point-of-Sale system. These returns can update inventory and be used to electronically or manually refund the client.



## 


## Accounts Report


Within the Reports window, you can filter results through a variety options and apply bulk actions.



## 


## Inventory Report


The Inventory Report allows you to quickly view your current inventory or on a specific date. Sorting options and detailed views let you quickly access information. Reports can be exported to Excel, Word or CSV format.



## 


## Unspent Money Report


The Unspent Money Report can be used to quickly address money left unspent at the end of a camper's time at a program.    


1. 1. From the main page in the store, click the Reports menu button.
	2. Click **Unspent Money**.


### 


### Quick Steps to Address Unspent Money


To use the Unspent Money Report to quickly clear the accounts for campers who are wrapping up their program time at your organization and not staying for future weeks, you can take the following steps. These changes should be processed prior to the End Date of the session.


1. 1. Verify that the **In Session Only** box and the **Does not have upcoming reservations** boxes are checked.
	2. Click the **View** button.
	3. Review the resulting list of individuals who are in a current session to make sure you wish to refund this group (you can uncheck anyone you do NOT wish to refund).
	4. At the bottom of the page, select the appropriate action from the dropdown menu and click the **Perform Action** button to execute the selected action.


 


**Perform Action Buttons**


* The first button addresses those individuals who have selected a preferred action and we recommend that you **Use Specified Action** for these individuals.
* The second is for those who have not specified a preferred course of action for their unspent money. Here, you can choose how to address these individuals.

## Receipt Printer Settings for Mozilla Firefox


Firefox has a known printing issue with receipt printers. By default, Firefox puts a date stamp at the bottom of printouts which can make a receipt printer waste considerable amounts of paper. The following instructions will show you how to address this issue within Firefox.


When using a Receipt Printer in Firefox, you will need to edit your Firefox settings. 


1. 1. In your Mozilla Firefox browser, click the Open menu icon (usually found in the upper right, it looks like three horizontal bars).
	2. In the menu, click the Print icon (looks like a printer).
	3. Click the Page Setup button (usually near the top left).
	4. In the resulting popup, go to the Margins and Header / Footer tab and set each of the Headers and Footers menus to blank.

# Queued Credit Card Processing
Queued credit card processing allows for the handling of a large volume of transactions by temporarily storing them in a queue and processing them in batches. 


As of February 2, 2023, this feature will be the default setting for all UltraCamp clients.


## How it Works


Queued processing is an UltraCamp setting that works with any credit card provider. As payments are submitted in the checkout process, we store them in a queue and process them in order, which can take from a few seconds to several minutes depending on your volume. The payment is displayed on the customer page as a "Queued Credit Card Payment". Once the payment goes through successfully, the customer receives an automated transaction receipt. No matter the length of time it takes for the queued payment to go through, the customer will still get their Confirmation Receipt for their reservation.


For payments that fail, the customer is notified immediately with instructions to correct their payment. If no action is taken by the customer, we retry the payment a second time 24 hours later. If this payment fails, we remove the queued credit card payment from their account. Note that a failed queued payment does not cancel their registration or change their status in any way. They will retain a balance on their account.


We have a summary email that is sent each morning to the Billing Contact role that details any failed payments.


*Example email showing total activity for the previous day:*





Abandoned payments list each payment, a link to the account, and the reason for failure.


The Transaction Summary displays in the Details column the status of your credit card payments. Queued payments display their current status. When the payments transmit successfully, it is replaced with the Gateway ID.


*Example Transaction Summary report showing various queued payments and their status:*





Queued payments that fail are attempted again 24 hours later. If they fail a second time, they are removed from the account and fall off of the Transaction Summary report.


## Transactions Affected


Queued processing is **only** for payments that go through the checkout process in the shopping cart. Payments made using the "Make a Payment" method on the Public side or the Admin side of UltraCamp are not queued and are processed immediately.


## Advantages


Smoother registration process- During high demand registration events, the heaviest use of server resources are taken by waiting for payment processing responses on the checkout page. Queued processing puts this in the background and allows rapid checkout with fewer slowdowns.


Higher conversion rate- About a third of all abandoned registrations happen in the final step of the registration process. Queued processing eliminates the abandonment of registrations from failed payments and helps with your conversion rate. Internal monitoring in UltraCamp shows over 80% of failed payments with queued processing are fixed by the parent on the same day.


Improved UltraCamp performance - By moving most credit card transactions to a queued model, we remove the bottleneck of waiting for credit card processor responses for checkout. During high demand, this can be noticeable by your parents.


## Opt-out Ability


Queued processing's advantages are many, but if you do not want to use it for your organization, there is an opt-out ability for smaller clients. If your largest registration day of the year is less than 500 reservations, you can request to remove Queued processing by submitting a support ticket. Queued processing is mandatory for larger organizations.


 

# Creating and Managing Group Preorder Templates
Group Preorder Templates control a leader's experience when they reserve a number of spaces in a session. What information leaders must provide, how many spaces they can reserve, and whether or not they must pay a deposit are all dictated by the template. Of course, a template must be connected to a session in order for its settings to affect registration.


**To find where to create and manage your Group Preorder Templates:**


1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the **Session Templates** section.
2. Click [Group Preorder Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/groupPreorderTemplateList.aspx).

* **Insert Content Here:** The message itself is written over the text "Insert content here" below your logo and contact information.
* **Display of Message:** At the bottom of the composition area, you can adjust the display of the message from the Design view (the default view) to the HTML view where you can interact with the html directly or to a Preview mode which hides the design markings and isn't editable but offers a look at the email appearance.

# Tax Receipts For Donors 
When Tax time approaches, UltraCamp has several ways to send tax receipts to donors. You can choose to print receipts for mailing or email them to donors directly. For both methods, the process starts with creating a stored **Donation Report**.


## 
Create a Donation Report


The first step in preparing donor tax receipts is to create a stored group that contains the information you’ll need for generating the receipts. A recommended way to do this is by running a Donations report. This can be done either under the Reports or Extra Services menu.


You can a donation report in one of two ways:


**Option A: Reports Menu**


1. 1. Go to **Reports** expand **Financial**.
	2. Click on **Donations**.
	3. Select the season or calendar date range that you want to pull donations for.
	4. Scroll to bottom and click **Load Report**.
		* You should now be shown a results list that contains all of the donations made for the time frame you indicated in the report parameters.

# Setting Up Staff Applications

 


Is your camp using UltraCamp for your staff application and hiring process? Learn about integrated background checks, automate employee reference invitations and task reminders for hired staff and more.


 

# Age Restrictions
A session can be restricted by age or grade depending on the Session Master template settings.


**To set Age or Grade Restrictions:**


1. 1. Go to **Settings menu.**
	2. Expand **Session Templates section.**
	3. Click on **Session Templates.**
	4. Create a **New Session Template** or edit an existing template using the **edit icon** to the right of the desired template.
	5. Once in the wizard, you may need to click the "Begin" button in order to proceed to this page.\*  Otherwise, you will be taken there directly.  
	\***Note:** if you previously clicked "Do not display this page to me again", you will not see that page.
	6. In the left menu, click on **Age Restrictions**



  
  



## Restricting a Session by Age


* Age Based Sessions have a minimum and maximum age limit.
* Limits are set on the master but can be amended on a session by session basis.
* UltraCamp will display these age limits on the public side, and only eligible individuals will be able to register for age-restricted programs.
* Eligibility is normally determined based on the age of the registrant on the session Start Date, however the calculation can be adjusted for any given session.
* A grace period can also be set (in months) to allow people to register who do not fit exactly the displayed restrictions.


 


## Restricting a Session by Grade


* A session can be restricted by age or grade depending on the Session Master template settings.
* Grade based sessions check for eligibility based on the attendee’s grade at the start of the session—not necessarily the current grade on the account.
* Grade restrictions can be set to any grade from Pre-K through College.
* An additional grade setting is “Not in School” which can indicate anyone outside the Pre-K to College parameters.


 


## Overriding Age and Grade Restrictions for Adult Registrants


* For events where age or grade is restricted but adults can attend, you can check the box to allow anyone designated as an adult to register for this session.



#### 
 Note


Unlike the other settings on the Age Restrictions page, this is a fixed setting for all sessions scheduled from this template.



 


  
  



  
  



  
  


# Improving Email Success
In order to provide the most reliable communication with your clients, we recommend that you implement *one* of the following two tweaks to your email setup:


* + Create at least one Email Sending Scheme.
	+ Add 'sender.ultracamp.com' to your SPF record in your email domain.


As email service providers improve security, using one of these techniques will help your emails avoid being flagged as spam or junk mail.


 


## Setting up an Email Sending Scheme


An Email Sending Scheme allows UltraCamp to send emails directly from your email server. This is the most effective way to make sure your emails are transmitted securely and reliably. *Because of the nature of these settings, it is important to work closely with your IT team when setting up and managing any email sending scheme.*


**To find where to create or manage Email Sending Schemes:**


1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the **Communication** section.
2. Click [Email Sending Schemes](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/EmailSendingSchemesList.aspx)


Here you can create new email sending schemes or edit existing ones.


 


#### Creating an Email Sending Scheme


In order to give UltraCamp the ability to send emails through your server, you'll need to create at least one Email Sending Scheme. To do this, take the following steps:


1. 1. Click the button **Create a new email sending scheme**.
	2. Fill in each of the fields provided.
		* The **Email Address** is the one you wish to send emails from.
		* The SMTP Host and Port, along with the IMAP Host and Port are based on the settings of your email host service.
		* The **Username** and **Password** must match permissions for your email provider.
	3. If your server necessitates the use of SSL, check the box to **Enable SSL**.
	4. [Optional but Recommended] In the **Test Connection** section, enter an email address into the **Send To** field and click the button to **Send Test Message**.
		* A notification will appear at the top of the screen, explaining if the test was successful or not.
	5. Click the **Save Scheme** button.


UltraCamp will now use these settings to send emails through your server. ***If there are any changes to the password or permissions at your service provider, these settings must be updated here as well.*** Failing to do so will prevent emails from being sent from UltraCamp using the specified address.



#### 
 Tip


For consistent communication, it is best to create an Email Sending Scheme for each email address you will use to communicate with clients.



 



#### 
 Note


Since you are now sending notifications through your email service provider, any limits on your email account will also impact the sending of emails from UltraCamp.


For example, if you are limited to a maximum number of emails sent per day, UltraCamp will no longer be able to send messages when that limit is reached. This would affect email receipts, automated reminders, confirmations, etc.



 


## Adding sender.ultracamp.com to your SPF Record


SPF is a security protocol that helps keep your email from being impersonated. Your SPF record determines which domains have permission to send emails on your behalf. Adding sender.ultracamp.com to your SPF record tells other security systems that our servers have permission to send on your behalf. This approach may not be as as effective as creating an Email Sending Scheme, but it does improve UltraCamp's ability to communicate with your clients. 


 


*Because the SPF record is part of your domain DNS record, it is important that you work with your IT team when making this kind of change.*



#### 
 Tip


If you'd like to verify that sender.ultracamp.com is already in your SPF record, you can find tools which will search this for you. Here is just one [web based tool](https://mxtoolbox.com/spf.aspx) that can be used to check for a specific SPF record.



 


## What if I just use the default settings?


UltraCamp's default behavior for communicating with your clients is to send emails from our email servers (usually from the unmonitored email: [notices@ultracamp.com](mailto:notices@ultracamp.com)) on behalf of your designated email address(es). Clients who reply to these emails will have their messages go directly to your email address.


Unfortunately with the increased security precautions email providers are taking, we are finding more and more messages using the default setup are being stopped from reaching your clients. We cannot guarantee that emails sent with the default setup will get through.


 



#### 
 Tip


No matter what email setup you decide to use, your clients can always log into their account to view any messages sent to their account through UltraCamp's **Message Center**.


# Retreat Communication
UltraCamp offers a number of tools to help with your communication with retreat and rental groups.


 


## Confirmation Options


When a retreat reservation is created, you can access several Confirmation options to send or print estimates, confirmations, and invoices. Each will include a list of all currently selected facilities and pricing, discounts, and deposits. 


* Select the **Email** link to open UltraCamp's email tool with the estimate, invoice, or confirmation pre-selected
* Select the **Print** link to generate a pdf of the estimate, invoice, or confimation


 



#### 
 Tip


To make the most of the email tool, we recommend setting up **Email Templates** to pull in your default messaging quickly and easily. You can learn how to [create Email Templates here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/9973916676372)



 


You can customize aspects of the language and appearance of the **Invoice** and **Confirmation** pdf by taking the following steps:


1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the "System / Management" section
2. Click [Retreat / Conference Settings](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Wizards/RetreatSetup/Default.aspx)
3. In the wizard, expand the **Settings** section and click [Confirmation Settings](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/RetreatSetup/confirmationsettings.aspx)
4. Update the desired settings
5. Click the **Complete** button to save your changes


The resulting pdf output will resemble the sample below:





 


## Quick Buttons


In addition to UltraCamp's default communication links, you can create custom Quick Buttons that automatically retrieve a custom Email Template and automatically attach any documents you have uploaded, including custom invoices.


 


To set up a quick button, you'll first need to create a customized Email Template. You can learn how to [create Email Templates here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/9973916676372). Once this is done, you can take the following steps to add or edit a Quick Button to your Retreat Reservation page:


1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the "Communication" section.
2. Click ['Quick Buttons'.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/correspondenceButtonsList.aspx)
3. Click "Create a New Correspondence Button" or the edit link next to an existing correspondence button in the list.
4. Enter the **Button Name**. This will appear below your button wherever it is displayed.
5. Select your **Email Template** from the dropdown.
6. Choose the page where you want your button to appear. For retreat communication, choose the **Retreat Reservation Detail**.
7. Click the button to **Save** your changes.


You should now be able to find your new Quick Button under the Correspondence section on the Retreat Reservation Detail page.

# Client Limits
## Setting Capacity Numbers


A capacity can be set so that you don’t overbook a particular event/session. Capacity numbers are set in the Session Master.


**To set Capacity Numbers:**


1. 1. Go to **Settings menu.**
	2. Expand **Session Templates section.**
	3. Click on **Session Templates.**
	4. Create a **New Session Template** or edit an existing template using the **edit icon** to the right of the desired template.
	5. Once in the wizard, you may need to click the "Begin" button in order to proceed to this page.\*  Otherwise, you will be taken there directly.  
	\***Note:** if you previously clicked "Do not display this page to me again", you will not see that page.
	6. In the left menu, click on **Client Limits.**



  
  



## Maximum Total Individual


The Maximum Total Individuals is your maximum capacity for attendees. 


* You can break this down further by gender if needed.
* If there are not gender limits, set these numbers to be equal to your Maximum Total Individuals.


 


## Session Waiting List


Sessions that have reached capacity (either a gender or total reservation capacity) can automatically enable a Waiting List. 


* Waiting lists maintain the order of individuals who sign up for the waiting list and can even guide clients to and through the registration process if space becomes available.
* UltraCamp can use a Session Waiting List to automatically manage a waiting list for each distinct event/session.
* Clients who sign up for a wait list have their positions held until space becomes available.
* Once a space opens up, an email can be sent to the client prompting them to log in and complete their reservation.
* UltraCamp can hold a waiting list space for a specified number of days. That also can be set as a default on the Master Template. Once this time expires, the spot will be passed on to the next person on the waiting list, and they will receive an email prompting them to log in and complete their reservation.


#### 


### Waiting List Email Prompt


UltraCamp's script to send the emails doesn't run immediately on capacity change unless the "**Perform Waiting List Check**" box is checked. There are a number of reasons for this, including people wanting time to contact parents individually and not overloading our servers with too many script requests.


Instead, a system-wide check is preformed around**7 a.m**., and emails are queued when space is available and the session is set to notify families


If you wish the notification and check to be performed at another time,


* Check the box to "**Perform Waiting List Check**:" and click the **Complete** button.
* UltraCamp will then initiate the aforementioned process.
* This can be done on the Capacity page in the Session Editing wizard for an individual session or via the Bulk Updates Tool.


#### 


#### Example: Default Email Message


**[Date]**


**[Your header]**


Space has become available in **[Session Name and Dates]** for **[Individual Name]**. To begin the registration process, click here, or simply login your account and register for the event.


Please contact the camp at **[your phone number]**or **[your email address]** if you have any questions.


 



#### 
 Tip


While UltraCamp’s default message contains all necessary information, you can set up your own template in the Email tool and send that message instead.



 


## Capacity Display Settings


* Advanced Setting option
* Determine the level of detail available to clients.
* By default, UltraCamp only displays whether or not a session has space in it.
* Using the Advanced Settings, you can set the actual remaining spaces to show to the public.


## 


## Group Ratios


* Advanced Settings for Group-based Session Templates
* On group-based sessions, you can use the Advanced Settings to set requirements for group reservations.
* Minimum and Maximum group sizes are set here.
* Additionally, an optional Required Adult/Child Ratio can be set to make certain that supervision or safety requirements (should there be any) are met.
* Finally, a Minimum number of adults per reservation can be set as well.


 



#### 
 Tip


For family programs, we recommend setting the Minimum number of Adults to 1 to prevent parents from accidentally (or otherwise) sending just their children to your event.

# Allocation Account Setup for Financial Tracking
UltraCamp offers a variety of financial reporting and tracking features, but you can get more out of these tools with Allocations Accounts. Allocation Accounts help you categorize and track how money is spent by your clients. Here is how they are intended to work:


* When payments are entered into UltraCamp, the funds are allocated toward reservations and other financial items.
* Your allocation accounts group those funds as needed for reporting.


Allocation Accounts can be assigned to every financial item in UltraCamp (except Care Pricing). This makes it possible to separate or combine income from different places, session types, or options, and that's just the beginning! Many organizations find Allocation Accounts make a convenient parallel to General Ledger accounts for bookkeeping that occurs outside UltraCamp.


 


To make the most of this powerful tool, you will consider the following steps:


* Creating Allocation Accounts.
* Defining any additional transaction types
* Adding Allocation Accounts to your financial items


## 


## Creating Allocation Accounts


To create Allocation Accounts:


1. 1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand **Accounting**
	2. Select **Custom Allocations Accounts**
		* If you are using a **cash basis** for your accounting system, you will only need to fill in the Account Number (Cash) field.
		* If you are using an **accrual basis** for your accounting system, you will want to configure all four columns.


 





*Example of Allocation Accounts configured for an accrual accounting setup.*


### 


### The 4 types of Allocations


* **Cash** - This assigned account will apply to all transactional information in the system such as payments (credits) or refunds (debits).
* **Receivables** - This assigned account will apply to sale entries that are past their due date and are unpaid.
* **Sales** - This assigned account will apply to sale entries that are due in the future.
* **Realized** - This assigned account will apply to sale entries that have reached their due date and are paid.


## 


### Default Allocation Accounts


UltraCamp has two built-in allocation accounts that you should set:


* Refund Liability Account
* Cash Account



#### 
 Note


It is important that you create a dedicated account in your Accounting system to handle Refund Liability.



### 


## Assign Allocation Accounts


Once your allocation accounts are created, assign them by going into the Settings menu and taking the following steps:


* Locate the Template or Category
* Click the Edit icon to the right
* Locate the Allocation Account dropdown menu
* Choose the desired Allocation Account
* Save your changes.


The exact location and steps will vary by template and category, but each one has a field where you can select the allocation account for that financial item. The possible areas where you can set allocation accounts include:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Settings menuSession TemplatesOption CategoriesOption TemplatesActivity TemplatesFacility CategoriesFacilitiesAdd-on Fee TypesPayment PlansSeasonal FeesDonation CategoriesDonation Options | Scheduling MenuSessionsSession OptionsActivities
  |


 


When Allocation Accounts are assigned at a template level, all items scheduled from that template will default to the same allocation account. A good example of this is with Session Templates:


* + If allocation accounts are only assigned to the Session Template, all activities, options, and fees for a  session will default to the single allocation account specified in the Session Template.
	+ Activities, Options and other fees can have their own allocation account separate from the Session Template. This is done by adding an allocation account to the activity, option or fee template.
	+ Scheduled items can have their own allocation accounts as well. This includes Sessions and Options. For this individual instance, setting an allocation account on a scheduled item will override any allocation settings on the template level.


 



Tip


To minimize work, we strongly suggest setting the allocation accounts in the Settings menu.



 


### Allocation Account Interactions


To help clarify the relation between the different places allocation accounts can be collected, you can refer to the guides below:


**Session-related Allocation Accounts**


* + Allocation accounts set at the session level will apply to all settings assigned to them unless the allocation account is set at a lower level.  For example, a session option will have the same allocation account as the session unless the allocation account is changed at either the Option Category or Option Template level.


               


**Donation Allocation Accounts**


* + Allocation accounts for donations can be set at the Donation Category and any Donation Template will inherit the category’s allocation account unless set on the Donation Template level.    


**Facility Allocation Accounts**


* + Facilities can also have their allocation account set at the Facility Category level and the Facility Templates will inherit the allocation account unless it is set at the Facility Template as well.


**Add-On Fee Allocation Accounts**


* + For Add-On Fees, allocation accounts will be set on the fee level.


       
  




#### 
Remember


If an allocation account is set at a lower level, it will override allocation settings at higher levels.


# Add, Edit, or Enter Medications
In order for medication information to be tracked in the system, it must first be added. Often, this is done during the registration process. Outside the registration process, medications can still be added or edited via the Person Detail page.    


**To add or edit medications:**


1. 1. Open the desired account.
	2. On the Account Detail page, click on the appropriate individual's name under Account Members.
	3. In the Medications menu on the right, click the **View / Edit** link.


## 



 


## Adding a New Medication


1. 1. Enter the **Medication Name**in the field provided.
		* Based on what you begin typing, UltraCamp will suggest medication names from a list of FDA approved medications.
	2. You may select from this list or enter a different med name.
	3. Select the **Route**for medication administration from the dropdown menu.
	4. In the **Schedule / Dosage**section, use the Select Schedule dropdown menu to indicate when the med should be administered and what the dosage should be.
		* Up to five different administration times / dosages can be indicated.
		* You may also add any Reason for Medication / Comments in the field provided.
	5. Click the **Save Medication** This will record the medication in the system, and it will display under Current Medications below.
	6. When you have finished entering medication information, click the Save and Proceed button.
		* This will return you to the Person Detail page (or move you to the next page in the registration process if you are making a reservation).


## 


## Editing an Existing Medication


Once a medication has been added, it will display in the Medications menu. 


1. 1. Click the View / Edit link
	2. Scroll down to the Current Medications section.
		* Here you can click the Edit link to the right of the desired medication to change its information.
	3. Record your changes in the database using one of the "**Save**" buttons at the bottom.
	4. You may use the **Delete** button to disable the medication. This hides the medication information from view.


 



#### 
 Tip


"Deleted" medications can still be reported on in the Medications roster.



 


## How a Client Enters Medications


It can be helpful to see what a client sees when entering medication. Here we will review the function and layout of the public page for adding and editing medication. Most clients will add medications as part of their initial registration process.


To see the medications page from the public point of view, you also may make a reservation, but there is a short cut to the Medications page itself. 


**Use the following steps to go directly to the Medications page:**


1. 1. Access an account (like the Test account).
	2. Click the Public View icon in the upper right. This will take you to the public side.
	3. Click on an account member's name. This will take you to the Person Detail.
	4. Use the **Manage Medications** button under Common Tasks OR in the expandable menus on the right, locate the **Medications menu** and expand it.
	5. Click the **Manage Medications** link to be redirected to the appropriate page.


Clients can also follow these steps to add or edit medications outside the registration process.


 





 


## Adding a New Medication


* **Medication Name:** To add a new medication, the Medication Name must be entered along with the Dosage.
* **Route:** Select the Route for medication administration from the dropdown menu.
* **Schedule/Dosage:** In the Schedule section, indicate the time of day as well as the days of the week when the medicine should be administered. You can also indicate different dosages and specific times as necessary.
* **Reason for Medication:** You may also add any Reason for Medication / Comments in the field provided.
* **Save Medication:**When you have added the appropriate information, save your changes by clicking the Save Medication button. This will record the medication in the system, and it will display under Current Medications below.
* **Save and Proceed:**When you have finished entering medication information, click the Save and Proceed. This will return you to the Person Detail page.


## 


## Editing an Existing Medication


Once a medication has been added, it will display in the Medications menu. 


1. 1. Click **Manage Medications**link.
	2. Scroll down to the **Current Medications**.
	3. Click the Edit link to the right of the desired medication to change its information via the popup window.


You can save or delete the medication using the buttons at the bottom of the popup window.


 



#### 
 Tip


When a client deletes a medication, it is disabled and hidden in their record but not wiped away completely. You can report on deleted medications in the Medications Roster.

# Tasks and Processes 
Tasks and Processes are a great way to manage items that you or a customer needs to complete. Tasks are like items on a checklist, and the process is like a checklist containing those tasks.





## 


## Tasks


If there are items you or your customers need to complete prior to their arrival, you can accomplish this with tasks. Examples of common tasks would be: Upload Immunization records, Schedule Interview, Upload signed Staff Contract. Upload insurance cards, etc.



#### 
 Note


Keep in mind that online forms already have a built in tracking and completion monitoring, so tasks would not be used for those. Use tasks for everything except online forms.



 


## To create a Task Template:


1. 1. Click on **Settings** and expand **System Management**.
	2. Click on Task Template.
	3. Select Create New Task Template.
	4. Set up your task settings and Save.


**Automated reminder emails**


* Each task can have have up to three automated reminder emails.
* These emails would be sent out on a schedule you determine.
* Only those who have not completed the task would get the reminder email.


 


## Processes


You can create a number of tasks and put them in a process. The process can then be attached to a session, so the associated tasks are automatically assigned when someone registers for that session.


**To create a Process:**


1. 1. Click on Settings and expand System Management.
	2. Choose Processes.
	3. Select Create New Process and name the Process and Save.

## 
Completed Tasks


If a task is set up to require a document upload, the public user can complete the task by uploading the appropriate document. The public user must go to the document center and follow the instructions for the associated document.


* To set up a task for a document to be uploaded, a placeholder document must be placed in the document center. Usually this is a PDF that contains the steps for the public user to follow to make sure their document is uploaded correctly.
* The document must have the same name as the document to be uploaded. For example, if an immunization record should be uploaded, the document center document would be named “Immunization Record Upload” (or something similar).
* The document must be set to allow public upload.


## 
Creating a Placeholder Document


**To upload a placeholder document:**


1. 1. Go to **Settings** and select **Communication**.
	2. Click on **Document Management**.
	3. Upload a New Document and fill in Document Name.

	10. Processed Document Completes Task: select the task that this uploaded document completes.
	11. Form Fill Binding: is not necessary here.
	12. Expiration Type: choose the desired expiration settings for this document.
	13. Allow Public Upload: check box to  "allow public upload".
	14. Save Document.

# Quick Buttons
In addition to UltraCamp's default communication links, you can create custom Quick Buttons that automatically retrieve a custom Email Template and automatically attach any documents you have uploaded.


To find where to create and edit quick buttons, take the following steps:


1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the "Communication" section.
2. Click ['Quick Buttons'.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/correspondenceButtonsList.aspx)


## How to Create or Edit Quick Buttons


To set up a quick button, you'll first need to create a customized Email Template. You can learn how to [create Email Templates here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/9973916676372). Once this is done, you can take the following steps to add or edit a Quick Button to your reservation detail page:


1. Click "Create a New Correspondence Button" or the edit link next to an existing correspondence button in the list.
2. Enter the **Button Name**. This will appear below your button wherever it is displayed.
3. Select your **Email Template** from the dropdown.
4. Choose the page where you want your button to appear, either the **Reservation** **Detail** or the **Retreat Reservation Detail**.
5. Click the button to **Save** your changes.


You should now be able to find your new Quick Button under the Correspondence section on the selected page.

# Scheduling Custom Questions Outside of Forms
Custom Questions can be used to gather information on an accounts, individuals, and reservations. Most often, Custom Questions are used in [Custom Online Forms](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7231482555284). However, there are situations where you may want to ask a question outside of a form. There are three places you can add questions outside of an online form: 


* During account creation
* When creating, editing, or confirming an individual person on an account
* During registration for a specific session


These three scenarios offer different ways to collect information and are managed outside of the Online Form tools.


**To add, reorder, and remove Account, Person and Session Custom Questions:**


1. 1. Go to the Scheduling menu
	2. Expand Custom Questions
	3. Click the appropriate link for Account, Person or Session Custom Questions


## 


## Account Custom Questions


Account Custom Questions are used to collect information for an account. These questions are collected once at the creation of an account and are not prompted for again.    


**To add schedule a new Account Custom Question:** 


1. 1. Choose the desired custom question master from the **Select Question** dropdown menu.
	2. Next click the **Add Question** This shifts the question to the currently scheduled Account Custom Questions listed below.


## 


## Currently scheduled account custom questions


Once a question has been added as an Account Custom Question, it will display in this section of the page.


* **Rank:** In this section, you can adjust the display order using the Rank field. Questions will display starting with the lower number through the highest number. To change the order, adjust the number in the field and click **Update**.
* **Deleting a Custom Question:** An account custom question can be deleted by clicking the **Delete** link to the right of the question. After proceeding through the confirmation prompt, the question will be removed as an Account Custom Question, and **all of its data will be permanently removed from the database**.


  
  



## 


## Person Custom Questions


Person Custom Questions are asked on an individual's biographical page and connected directly to that individual. Person Custom Questions are generally used to collect static individual information beyond the defaults as set by UltraCamp.    


**To add a new Person Custom Question:** 


1. 1. Choose the desired custom question master from the **Select Question** dropdown menu.
	2. Check **Summary** if you want this information in the Confirmation email.
	3. Next click the **Add Question** This shifts the question to the currently scheduled Account Custom Questions listed below.


## 


## Currently scheduled person custom questions


Once a question has been added as a Person Custom Question, it will display in this section of the page.

* **Deleting a Custom Question:** An account custom question can be deleted by clicking the **Delete** link to the right of the question. After proceeding through the confirmation prompt, the question will be removed as a Person Custom Question, and **all of its data will be permanently removed from the database.**


 



#### 
 Tip


Person Custom Questions work best for collecting individual information which does not change. Clients will only answer these questions when they first create the individual account member or when prompted to update their information as part of the registration process. Use Custom Online Forms for greater flexibility and to collect data that may change from year to year.



 


## Session Custom Questions


Session Custom Questions are used to gather non-financial information about a particular session reservation.


**To add a new Session Custom Question:** 


1. 1. Select the session from the dropdown menu
	2. Choose the desired custom question master from the **Select Question** dropdown menu.
	3. Check Confirmation to include this information in the Confirmation email.
	4. Next click the **Add Question** This shifts the question to the currently scheduled Account Custom Questions listed below.


## 


## Questions currently assigned to this session


Once a question has been added as a Session Custom Question, it will display in this section of the page.


* **Rank:** In this section, you can adjust the display order using the Rank field. Questions will display starting with the lower number through the highest number. To change the order, adjust the number in the field and click **Update**.
* **Deleting a Custom Question:** An account custom question can be deleted by clicking the **Delete** link to the right of the question. After proceeding through the confirmation prompt, the question will be removed as an Session Custom Question, and **all of its data will be permanently removed from the database**.


 



#### 
 Tip


Session Custom Questions are best used to track information that could vary if the attendee were to also enroll in another session. The best example of this is a buddy or cabin-mate request.


For information that could carry over from session to session, we recommend using [**custom online forms**.](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7231482555284)



 

# How to Delete a Session
Before deleting a session make sure that the session has no current reservations and there is no financial history attached to this session. If either of these are true, you should cancel all reservations first. 


If any payments have been made toward this session, you should hide the session from the public and close registration, but not delete it.



#### 
 Tip


Before deleting a session, we recommend updating the session name to include "Delete this Session" in the name. This is optional but makes it easier to avoid accidentally deleting the wrong session.



 


**To delete the session:**


1. 1. Click on the My Sessions menu.
	2. Select Summary of Sessions.
	3. Summary of Sessions page.
	4. Click on **Delete a Session** in the list of Common Tasks, just above your list of Scheduled Sessions.
	5. Select the correct session from the drop-down menu.



#### 
 Note


Once you delete a session, it cannot be undeleted. This is why we recommend updating the name of the session before you begin, to make it easy to identify the session to delete.



1. 6. On the Confirm Session to Delete page, verify that this is the session you want to delete.
	7. Click on **Yes, delete this session**.


Follow through any remaining prompts until you see a message that the action has been completed.

# How Do Options Work?
Options are used to offer additional choices and selections to anyone registering for your sessions. Options are specifically designed to let individuals make selections from a list of one or more items. For example, options can be used to let individuals sign up for extended care, purchase additional shirts, or even indicate they want to sign up for financial aid.


 


To make options available for your clients, you will need to complete three steps:


1. 1. Create Option Categories.
	2. Create Option Templates.
	3. Schedule your Options to your session(s).


Once these steps are completed, your clients will be able to make these additional choices during registration.


 


### Option Categories


Option Categories control certain behaviors for all options within their category. These behaviors include the following:


* + How options display
	+ How many options can be selected
	+ Whether a selection is required
	+ Whether discounts can apply to option fees


You can learn more about setting up [Option Categories here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7228683795604).


 


### Option Templates


Option Templates are the items your client will select during registration. When you create the templates, you will control a variety of settings, including:


* + Option price
	+ Availability limits
	+ Age restrictions
	+ The ability to trigger additional registration activity, like other options, forms, or confirmation information


You can learn more about creating [Option Templates here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7228685649300).


 


### Scheduling Options


When you Schedule options you choose which options will be associated with each of your sessions.


Once options have been scheduled, your clients will be able to make selections from them based on the settings you put in place.


You can learn more about [Scheduling your Options here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7228701523988).


 


### Options During Registration


Depending on what you choose during setup, options will display in a number of different ways in the registration process. The image below will give you a preview of what options might look like to your clients based on the settings you indicate:


 





### 


### Options in Reporting


Options can be reported on using both standard and custom reports.


Two of the most frequently used standard reports are:


* + The [Session Roster](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Reports/SessionRoster.aspx)
	+ The [Session Options Roster](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Reports/sessionOptionsReport.aspx)


In custom reporting, you can pick and choose from a number of option-related data fields. Here are a couple of popular Data Fields:


* + **List - Options** in the Reservation Information section will display a single field with all the options selected for that reservation.
	+ Any Option Category from the **Option Category Selections** section will display a data field with the client choice(s) from that category only.
	+ An option from the **Has Session Option** section will display a field with a "Yes" if the client has selected that option. A "No" will be displayed if the client hasn't chosen that option.


You can learn more about creating custom reports in our [webinar series here](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/9708342421524).

In UltraCamp, learn how to leverage last year’s templates and information to optimize this year’s setup. If you’ve set up sessions before, you don’t need to start over again from scratch. In this webinar we’ll show you how to save time and streamline the setup process.

# How to Enable Group Preorders for a Session
If you want leaders to be able to reserve slots for members of their group, you will need to first have a **[Group Preorder Template](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/10848101419796)**. Once you have created your template, you can enable it for a session by taking the following steps:


1. Open the **Session Editing Wizard** for the session you want to work with.
2. Navigate to the **Capacity** page in the **Basic Settings** section.
3. Choose the appropriate **Group Preorder Template** from the dropdown menu.
4. Click the **Complete** button.


With your changes saved, you can exit the wizard.


The session is now enabled for Group Preorders. When anyone registers, they will be prompted to indicate if they are signing up individually, as a member of a group, or as a group leader. If they select the "group leader" option, they will be guided through the steps of reserving spaces.


 



#### 
 Tip

	2. Click the **Make / Record a Payment** button (on either the *Account Detail* or *Finance Detail* pages)
	3. Click **Credit Card Payment**
	4. Choose your **Select Payment Date**settings
		* *Make my payment now* will initiate the transaction immediately
		* *Make my payment on* lets you specify a date in the future to initiate the transaction
	5. Indicate the **Payment Amount**


***Optional Settings:***


* 1. + Click the *Pay in Full* link to pay the current Account Balance
		+ If your organization is set up to use *Convenience Fees*, the calculated fee will display here. To override the fee, uncheck the **Automatically Calculate** box and adjust the fee in the text field. The Payment Total will display below.

		+ Select an existing credit card if it has been previously entered
	3. Click the **Submit / Schedule Payment**


 


**Why no CVV?**At this time, UltraCamp doesn't use the Credit Verification Value (CVV) for several reasons. CVV is a fraud prevention device but it cannot be stored. This means that CVV prevents all scheduled payments. Instead UltraCamp uses Address Verification Service as fraud prevention. In addition to allowing scheduled payments to work, it also gives you lower interchange rates with your merchant processor.


  
  



## Additional Options


* UltraCamp will automatically allocate these funds on its own, but you can override this and allocate the funds manually by checking the box to *Specify how this payment should be applied*.
* *Print a Receipt* of this transaction,

## 


## How ACH Payments Work


* ACH payments transfer money electronically from an individual's bank account to yours.
* This payment functions very much like a check payment and is processed through the Automated Clearing House (ACH). ACH payments function very much like paper checks--they take several days to clear and may be returned if there are insufficient funds in the designated account or account information is incorrect.


## 


## ACH Pre-Notes and First Time Payments


* The first time an ACH payment is made, UltraCamp must verify that the bank account entered actually exists.  To verify an account, UltraCamp sends a Pre-Note.  This Pre-Note behaves like a transaction and takes 3-5 business days to process but doesn't incur processing fees and doesn't withdraw any money from a bank account.
* If the Pre-Note confirms the entered account is real, UltraCamp submits the ACH payment for processing.  This extends the time between when a first payment is initiated and when it is received.  However, after an account is confirmed this process will not be repeated, and all future payments will process normally.
* If the Pre-Note cannot confirm the entered account, the ACh payment is not processed and no fees are incurred by your organization.  An alert is sent to the client about the payment failure.

## Step 1: Create a Stored Group


* Most reports can generate a stored group.
* Choose a report that gives you list of the individuals for whom you wish to print medical forms.
* When you run the report, use the **upload icon** to save this information as a stored group.
* If you use a custom report, look for a Store this information link instead of the icon.


## 


## Step 2: Retrieving Your Forms


Once you've created a Stored Group with individuals for whom you wish to print the forms,


1. 1. Go to the **Reports** menu and expand the **Forms** section.
	2. Click **Online** Forms.
	3. In the **Select Form** dropdown menu, choose your Health History Form. This will bring up an additional set of filters.
	4. In the **Who is also in** dropdown menu, choose your stored group from Step 1.
	5. Click the **Search** button.
	6. [Optional] In the list of forms, uncheck boxes of any forms you do NOT want to print.
	7. Scroll to the bottom and click the **Print Selected** button.


This will queue the process of generating your pdf and redirect you to the My Jobs page.


 


## Step 3: Downloading the PDF from My Jobs


When you click the **Print Selected** button, each Health Form that has a checked box to the left will be submitted to the **My Jobs** processor. You will also be redirected to the My Jobs page.


On the My Jobs page, you will see your Health form queued up and then begin to process. When the job is complete, an icon will display.


* Click the icon to request a download of the combined Health Form PDF file.
* Follow the prompts in your browser to download and/or open the PDF.


  
  


# Registration Information
A variety of settings that allow customization for the registration process.


**To setup Registration Information:**


1. 1. Go to **Settings menu.**
	2. Expand **Session Templates section.**
	3. Click on **Session Templates.**
	4. Create a **New Session Template** or edit an existing template using the **edit icon** to the right of the desired template.
	5. Once in the wizard, you may need to click the "Begin" button in order to proceed to this page.\*  Otherwise, you will be taken there directly.  
	\***Note:** if you previously clicked "Do not display this page to me again", you will not see that page.
	6. In the left menu, click on **Registration Information.**



#### 
 Tip


If **Display Fast Track Transition** is enabled under Advanced Settings, a person who is registering for multiple sessions at once will see a page indicating that the next session's registration has begun. This will occur between each session's registration. 


If disabled, they will not see the extra page and will continue through the registration process for all the sessions selected.



 



  
  



## Page Order Template


This is an optional area to determine when and what a client encounters in the registration process. Page Order Templates are created in the [Settings menu](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/pageordermasters.aspx) and attached or disabled here at any time. 


**To create a Page Order Master:**


1. 1. Go to **Settings menu.**
	2. Click on **Session Templates.**
	3. Select [**Page Order Templates**](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/pageordermasters.aspx)**,**attach or disable here at any time.


* + - If enabled here, it is a Fixed Setting and will therefore be true for all sessions scheduled from this template.
		- Customize the registration experience by adjusting the “Page Order” for registration.
		- This order can be set for all sessions created from this template with a Page Order Master or on an individual session level later (in the Session Editing Wizard).





 


## Preventing Overlapping Reservations


Prevent clients from registering for multiple sessions which occur within the same date range or overlap. 


* Selecting Prevent Overlapping Reservations can prevent clients from double-booking themselves.



#### 
 Tip


This feature can be used to prevent double-booking for recurring daily programs—like summer enrichment classes—by setting a Daily Start Time and Daily End Time on the individual session or event.



 


## Collect Store Money


UltraCamp can collect money during checkout for a store or “canteen” at your location. This allows parents to deposit money electronically so that their child’s purchases can be made in person without the child carrying cash. 


* Check the **Collect Store Money box** to permit the client to add this money electronically prior to checkout.


**Two options for managing Store Money:**


1. 1. Collect the money at checkout, then track purchases and refund this money as necessary outside of our database.
	2. Use the integrated Point-of-Sale system.


* + - The Point-of-Sale system allows parents to add and track money and expenditures in real-time, gives you inventory tracking capabilities, enables electronic refunds, and much more.


If you are interested in using the integrated Point-of-Sale system, feel free to contact us at **888-791-2080** for more information.


 


## One-Way Email


If you’ve enabled the One-way Email feature in [My Settings](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/emailenabled.aspx), you can check this box to engage that feature for sessions scheduled from this template.


 


## Donations by Session


**If enabled, Donations can be set to appear before checkout.** 


* Based on your database settings, you can either have all donation options display prior to checkout, no donations display prior to checkout, or specific donations display prior to checkout.
* The Donations page will only show once prior to checkout for each time the client logs into their account, even if multiple sessions are selected.


**In the My Settings wizard, you can determine whether or not to prompt for all Donation Categories to display prior to checkout.**


* If you choose not to do this, you will have the option in the **Session** **Editing wizard** to have specific categories display or no categories at all. This is determined by checking off the appropriate boxes.


  
  


# Adding Comments
Comments are added and edited using the menu on the Account Detail page. Existing comments are viewable here until they expire.


**To view, edit or add comments:**


1. 1. From the Person Detail Page, expand the **Additional Information Section.**
	2. To edit a comment, click on the edit icon.
	3. To add a new comment, click on the **Add a Comment link.**


  
  



## Adding Comments


1. 1. Clicking the Add Comment link will bring up the Create a new Comment page.
	2. You will be prompted to select who or what This comment is for using the dropdown menu.
		* Depending on your selection, you may be asked to indicate a specific individual or reservation.
	3. In the Comment field, enter the appropriate text.
		* By default, comment text is not Visible by the Public as indicated by the checkbox.
		* If you check this box, however, clients will be able to view the comment when they access their account.
		* A comment remains recorded in the system unless manually deleted. However, a comment can be hidden after a set Expiration Date.


 


**Expiration Date setting options:**


* A comment with **No Expiration** remains visible on the account indefinitely.
* A comment set to expire at the **End of the current season** will no longer display after the date indicated as the Season End Date.
* A comment can also be set to no longer display after a **Custom Date** as set with the text field and/or the calendar picker.


## 


## Editing Comments


* Once a comment has been created, you can edit it using the link in the Comment menu.
* When editing, you may change the comment text, public visibility, and its expiration date. However, the Creation Date, who it was Created By, and how the comment is attached may not be adjusted.
* A comment can be deleted using the button at the bottom of the page.



#### 
 Tip


Comments, both active and expired, can be reported on using the Comments report.


Reporting differs slightly based on how you attach a comment. Attaching session-related comments to Sessions will make reporting on that type of comment easier.


# Upload a Transaction File
Uploading transactions is an advanced feature in UltraCamp.



#### 
 Note


Before attempting this for the first time, it is recommended that you consult with an UltraCamp Support Specialist.



 


## Step 1: Prepare the CSV file


To upload transactions to UltraCamp, a CSV file is required. This can be generated outside of UltraCamp or by downloading an UltraCamp report.


* You must change the name of the worksheet tab in the CSV file to *Sheet1*
* Only the first tab will be read by UltraCamp
* Each column must have a column header (no special characters).
* A column in the CSV file must contain transaction amounts without special characters (no $ or - symbols)
* Additional recommended columns:
	+ **idAccount** - to accurately link transactions to an UltraCamp account
	+ **transactionDate** - when this transaction should show as having occurred
	+ **transactionMemo** - to provide better reporting and identification (for example, "Offline Bulk Check Upload from 1/13/2021")
* The CSV file should have a short, recognizable name without special characters or spaces


 



#### 
 Tip


If you include a column with the idSession Assignment, UltraCamp will attempt to allocate the payment to that specific session's fees in Step 2!



 


## Step 2: Upload the CSV file


1. Go to the **Tools** menu and expand **Financial**
2. Select Upload a Transaction File
3. Use the button next to Select File to choose the CSV file on your computer from Step 1
4. Click the **Upload File** button
5. On the resulting page (See image below), make the following setting adjustments:
	* In the **Select ID Field**, choose idAccount
	* **ID Field corresponds to** the UltraCamp Account ID
	* In the **Transaction Type Field** use the second column to select the desired Transaction Type from the dropdown menu
	* In the **Amount Field** use the dropdown menu to select the column header from the excel file for the transaction amount
6. [*Optional but recommended*] Check the box to "Load in the background"
7. Click the **Create Transactions** button


  
  



  
  


# Add Fees
Some fees don't fall neatly into store purchases or session fees. The Add Fees feature can place a non-refundable fee or additional fee directly onto the account.


**To find where to add fees:**


1. 1. Open the desired account.
	2. Under Common Tasks, Click View Financial History.
	3. Select the Add Fees button under Common Tasks. You may then select the desired fee type.


 





  
  



## Add a Non-refundable Session Fee


A **Non-refundable Session Fee** bills an individual for a session while not placing them on the session roster for that program.  Monies paid towards a non-refundable session fee are still allocated toward that session. 


**To add a Non-refundable Session Fee:**


1. 1. Open the desired account.
	2. Click **View Financial History.**
	3. Click **Add Fees** under Common Tasks.
	4. Choose **Non-refundable Session Fee.**

		* Choose a **Session** from dropdown menu.
		* Indicate which **Individual**to assign the fee to.
		* Enter the desired **Fee Amount.**
	6. Click the **Add Fee** button.



#### 
 Tip


When adding a non-refundable session fee, be specific about the Individual you are assigning the fee. This will display on the financial record!



## 


## Add a Seasonal Fee


A Seasonal Fee is charged once per season.  It is not a session fee, but it is usually triggered by making a reservation.


**To manually add a Seasonal Fee, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Open the desired account.
	2. Click **View Financial History.**
	3. Click **Add Fees** under Common Tasks.
	4. Choose **Seasonal Fee.**
	5. Select the appropriate Seasonal Fee from the dropdown menu.
	6. Enter the Seasonal Fee information.
		* Indicate the **Fee Amount.**

		* Select the correct **Season** for the fee.
		* If the fee is Person-based, indicate who the fee is to be **Applied To.**
	7. Click the **Insert Fee**button.

		* Enter the **Fee Amount.**
		* Record a **Comment**which will be visible to the Primary Contact.
# Account Tools
## Make Account Inactive


* An inactive account is no longer accessible to the client and does not display in standard reporting.
* You can make an account inactive using the appropriate Account Tools.
* Once an account is inactive, the Primary Contact may no longer log into the account, and standard reports will not display the account unless specifically told to display inactive accounts. Administrators can still access the account, although the Open Account function will not return any inactive accounts.
* An inactive account can be reactivated using the link in the alert at the top of the Account Detail page for the inactive account.



#### 
 Tip


Making an account inactive is usually preferable to deleting the account. An inactive account retains all important historical and financial data, keeping your records clean and intact.



 


## Delete Account


* When an account is deleted from the database, all record of any activity within that account is permanently removed.
* Safety features in UltraCamp prevent administrators from deleting an account if there are any financial records or a reservation history.
* A Delete Account link may appear if there is no reservation or financial history on an account. Selecting this link will trigger a warning prompt since the deletion of this account is permanent and all correspondence and biographical information will be wiped completely from the database. Proceed through the prompt to delete the account.



#### 
 Tip


Often it is better to make an account Inactive, rather than delete it. An inactive account is still stored in the database but is inaccessible to the client while preventing the client from using the same email address to create a new account. Additionally, it is not displayed in most reports.



 


## Merge another account with this account


Two or more accounts can be merged into a single account, preserving historical, reservation, and financial information. No data is deleted when two accounts are merged (except the login information on the account that is not kept). An account merge cannot be undone.    


**Open the account you wish to keep:**


1. 1. On the Account Detail page
	2. Expand the Account Tools menu on the right
	3. Click on **Merge another account with this account**


  
  



* Within the Merge Accounts tool, you can elect to have UltraCamp automatically search for accounts that appear similar to this account or set up your own search using an Account Number, Last Name, and/or First Name. Click the Search button to initiate the search.
* Any accounts that match your search criteria will display in a list, along with the Account Members, contact information, and Account Creation Date. Select the account you would like to merge into the current account using the radio button on the left, and click the Next button.
* UltraCamp will provide an overview of the two merged accounts. The Account to Keep is the current account and will retain its login information. The Account to Delete will have all its historical data merged into the current account. Its login information will be removed along with the old Account Number.
* UltraCamp can attempt to merge individuals in these two accounts who have the same first and last name. This prevents duplicates of individuals from being created on the same account. However, if a parent and child share the same name, this action can have the added consequence of merging the parent and the child as well so this feature should be used with caution. Unchecking this box will prevent UltraCamp from running this process during the merge and preserve every account member from each account.


1. 4. Use the **Merge Accounts** button to initiate the merge. A warning will pop up. Proceed through this warning to complete the merge.



#### 
 Tip


An Account Merge cannot be undone. It's good to double check your information before merging two or more accounts.



 


## Merge two individuals within this account


One or more individual account members can be merged into a single account member. This is useful when duplicates are created either by the client or when merging multiple accounts. 



#### 
 Note


Merging two individuals cannot be undone. It's good to double check the person ID to make sure you are keeping the right person. The person ID is displayed on the Person Detail page in the Bio / Contact information menu.



 


**To merge individuals within the account:**


1. 1. Go to the Account Detail page of the account with duplicate individuals.
	2. Find the Account Tools menu on the right and expand it.
	3. Click the link to Merge two individuals within this account


* + UltraCamp will prompt you to select an Account Member to merge. This individual will have their biographical data, including person custom question data, deleted and replaced by the individual you select as the person to be kept.
	+ All reservation and custom online form data from both individuals will be kept.


1. 4. Click the **Merge People** button and proceed through the warning to complete the merge.

# Payment Refunds and Voids
If a credit card payment has settled, you can refund the money electronically to the original credit card account. This process often takes 3 to 5 business days once initiated.   



  
  



## Initiate a Credit Card Refund


1. 1. Click the **View** **icon** to the right of the payment you wish to refund.
		* This will take you to the Transaction Detail page.
	2. On the Transaction Detail page, you can verify the **Status**of the transaction.
		* If the status is *Pending* you may only void the transaction.
	3. Click the **Refund This Transaction** button under**Common Tasks**on the left side of the page.
	4. In the resulting popup, enter the **Refund Amount**
		* You can also enter any **Comments**you wish to add to the record.  The Primary Contact on the account *will*be able to see these comments.
	5. Click the **Issue Refund** button at the bottom to transmit the money back to the client's credit card.



#### 
 Note


Credit card refunds must be refunded to the original card used in the transaction. It is not possible to refund a different credit card.


If the original credit card is no longer available, you can issue paper check or leave the funds on the account as credit.



## 


## Transmitted or Settled Payments


Only payments that have transmitted or settled can be refunded. 


* Payments that have a Pending status will be voided if you attempt to refund the card.
* When a payment is voided, no money is actually taken out of the client's account.
* A hold may be placed on the funds temporarily due to the initial request for the money, but that usually drops off by evening.


## 


## Voiding a Credit Card Transaction


If a credit card transaction has not transmitted or completed, it can be voided.  When a payment is voided, no money is actually taken out of the client's account.  A hold may be placed on the funds temporarily due to the initial request for the money, but that usually drops off by evening.


1. 1. Open the desired account
	2. Go to the **Financial History / Finance Detail**
	3. Click the **View icon** next to the Credit Card Payment you wish to refund.
	4. Click the **Void Transaction**button under the Common Tasks on the left.
	5. This button only shows if the status of the transaction is *Pending*. If this button does not show, you will have to refund the transaction.
	6. In the resulting popup, confirm the void action.


## 


## Check or Cash Refund


When refunds need to be processed outside of UltraCamp, they should still be recorded on the account to maintain financial accuracy. 


1. 1. On an account, go to the **Account Detail** or the **Finance Detail** page.
	2. Click the **Make/Record a Payment** button.
	3. Select the **Other Payment** option to open the payment page.
	4.


## Transaction Details


1. In the **Transaction Type** dropdown menu.
2. Select either "Check Refund" or "Cash Refund."
3. Enter the amount of the refund in the **Transaction Amount**
	* If applicable, you can record the Check Number for the refund check.
4. If you wish to record a different **Transaction Date**from today's date, you can enter it in an 'mm/dd/yyyy' format.
5. Leaving that field blank will record the transaction as occurring today.
6. Click the **Submit Payment button** to finish recording the refund.


## 


## Transaction Memo


Comments made in this memo field WILL be displayed on confirmation information the client receives and are therefore visible to the client.


* 


## Additional Options


**Send Receipt**: A receipt can automatically be sent to the client by checking the Send Receipt box.



#### 
 Note


The box to Specify how this payment should be applied should NOT be used when creating a refund payment.



## 


## ACH Payments Void and Refund


ACH payments function differently than credit cards.  


* The first time an ACH Payment is made from a bank account, UltraCamp will run a prenote check to verify the existence of the account. The total first transaction time can take up to 10 business days. Once the account has been verified, the payment will be processed.
* Once an account has been verified, the prenote check will not be run again and payments will process in 5-7 business days.


## 


## Voiding an ACH Payment:


1. 1. 1. Open the account in question.
		2. Proceed to the Financial History / Detail page.
		3. Scroll down to the Payment section and locate the ACH payment.
		4. Click the **View icon** to the right of the payment to access the Payment Detail page.
		5. Click the **Void button** at the top left side of the page .
		6. Proceed through the prompts to prevent the transaction.



#### 
 Tip


Once a transaction has been voided, a hold may temporarily remain on the funds in the bank. This can make it look to the client like the payment is still there. The hold will prevent access to those funds, but no money will actually be removed from their account. This hold will drop off when the bank batches out, usually the evening of the day when the void is processed.



 


## 
Refunding an ACH Payment


Once an ACH payment has been completed, it can be refunded electronically.  To record a manual refund, try the following steps:  



1. 1. Click the **View** **icon** to the right of the payment you wish to refund.
		* This will take you to the **Transaction Detail** page.
	2. On the Transaction Detail page, you can verify the **Status**of the transaction.
		* If the status is *Awaiting Pickup, Awaiting Account Verification or Verifying Account,* you may only void the transaction.
		* If the status is *Collecting Funds*, *Verifying Funds*, *Released*or *Settled*, the transaction can no longer be voided. However, because the payment has not cleared, it also cannot yet be refunded.
		* If the status is *Settled* you may proceed to refund the transaction.
	3. Click the **Refund This Transaction button** at the top left side of the page.
	4. In the resulting popup, enter the **Refund Amount**
		* You can also enter any Comments you wish to add to the record.  The Primary Contact on the account *will*be able to see these comments.
	5. Click the **Issue Refund** button at the bottom to transmit the money back to the client's bank account.


  
  


# Label Maker 
UltraCamp can generate a page of labels based on information from your database. Labels are created from a stored group, which allows for a great deal of customization.  


**Info**: A stored group must be created first, before it can be used for labels.



  
  



## Create Labels


To create labels:


1. 1. Go to the **Tools** menu and click on **Correspondence**.
	2. Select [**Label Maker**.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Reports/LabelMaker.aspx)
	3. Select stored group from dropdown menu.
	4. Select **label template** from downtown menu or enter Avery Code and click **Next**.
	5. Select a previously saved template, this will populate the Label Design area with the template's personalization fields or save the existing Label Design for future use as a template by clicking the **Save as a new template**.
	6. Use the **Label Design** field to compose your label. Any text you type in this field will appear on each label.



#### 
 Tip


Depending on the Label template you select, you can do more than just create labels--the Label Maker can be used to create such things as nametags, ID cards, and personalized letters.



 


### Label Design


* **Personalization Fields:**To customize each label with unique individual information, you will need to use the Personalization Fields found in the dropdown menu. Place your cursor where you want the personalized information and then select the desired field from the dropdown menu.
	+ UltraCamp will place a set of code at your cursor. When the labels are generated, this code will be replaced with the appropriate personalized data.
	+ Simple HTML can be used to change the font size, color, etc. of label text. Examples are provided on the Label Maker page as reference.
* **Labels Per Record:** You may generate multiple copies of a label by entering a number greater than 1 in the Labels per record field.
* **Repeat Pattern:**If you indicate you wish to print multiple **labels per record**, you can designate the Repeat Pattern using the provided radio buttons.
* **Create Labels:**click when ready to generate a pdf.



#### 
 Tip


When printing labels, be sure that you are printing labels at "Actual Size" and that any sort of "Shrink to Fit" or Page Scaling is off. Otherwise the label text will drift as the labels print and may not even fit on the physical label. If you don't see these settings in your Print Settings for the label, you may need to download the file and open it with Adobe Reader or another pdf reader software.

# Background Checks
UltraCamp offers integrated background checks through True-Hire. Background checks can be submitted on National or National and Regional levels. Submitted background checks will incur additional fees based on your region and the type of check run Background checks are an option available under extra services. 


## 


## How Background Checks Work


TrueHire offers three variations of the background check, the Basic background check, the Standard background check, and the Standard Background Check Plus. In addition, a Motor Vehicle check can be added to either of these.


All background checks begin with the individual's, name, Social Security number, and birth date and runs a trace to confirm their identity and find any aliases or other names the individual may use or have used.


### 1579037884062-Background_checks.jpg


* \*The cost for a **Basic** search is $11.99. If this turns up a local flag, additional costs can apply for the resulting county search.
* \*\*The cost for a **Standard** search is $21.99 plus the county fees for the county of current residence. If this turns up additional local flags, additional county costs can apply for the resulting local search.
* \*\*\*The cost for a **Standard Plus** search is $24.99 plus the county fees for the county of current residence and up to two additional counties of previous residence. If this turns up additional local flags, additional county costs can apply for the resulting local search.
* \*\*\*\*Certain states apply court fees and may apply a separate motor vehicle fee. View [**County Court Fees**](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/5506/858774/Court_Fees.pdf) and [**Motor Vehicle Record Fees**](https://static.helpjuice.com/helpjuice_production/uploads/upload/image/5506/858775/MVR_Fees.pdf).



#### 
 Tip


The Basic Background Check is recommended for staff and volunteers who will not be left alone with campers. For individuals who will be responsible for children and alone with them, the Standard Background Check provides better information and protection.


When running a background check, a pop-up window will warn you if additional fees apply.



 


### Add Ons


In addition to the background check, you may elect to run a Motor Vehicle check. This searches for DUI and vehicle offenses listed for the current driver's license.


The cost of Motor Vehicle check is $7.75 plus the DMV/Court fee. These fees vary widely from state to state.


## 


## Agreeing to a Background Check (Public Side)


* On the Background Check Information page, clients will be required to enter their legal identification information, including their full Legal Name, Gender, Social Security number, Date of Birth and Driver's License information.



#### 
 Note


Clients submitting background checks should use their legal name, avoiding nicknames, and verify all information before submitting. Searches that result in errors are still charged the search fee.



 


  
  



* Finally, a client will be required to accept the background check policy before proceeding using the Next button. The background check policy can be read using the provided link. The text is also included below:

## 


## FAQ: Background Checks


Background checks are available UltraCamp through [**True Hire**](https://true-hire.com/). Some personal information is needed to run a background check. 


 


### Why Is A Social Security Number Needed?


One of the greatest misconceptions about background checks is most people think that criminal records are attached to an individual’s social security number. In fact, criminal records are stored on one’s name and date of birth. If you were to search a criminal record database with no tother identifier besides a name, you would see criminal records for everyone with that name.  
  
True Hire conducts a social security number trace on every applicant to ensure that we are background screening the exact person you are looking for. This SSN Trace provides us with a closer look into your applicants address history and shows any former names they may have had. Using this information, True Hire will accurately match any criminal records found on both the national and county level with your applicant.


 


### How The Applicant's Information Protected?


True Hire’s background check system is fully secure and robust. We take all security measures when dealing with personal identifying information (PII). We understand that your applicant’s information and data is important, and we take the responsibility seriously. Additionally, our database is secured with a standard SSL certificate. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard technology securing internet connection and protecting any sensitive data that is being sent between systems.  
  
True Hire has a full in-house team of certified investigators that have both the knowledge and experience to conduct complaint background checks. You can rest easy that your applicants’ information is bot secure and protected.


 


### Is True Hire Accredited?


True Hire was recently awarded accreditation by the Professional Background Screening Association Accreditation (PBSA). This means that we go above and beyond to provide our clients with accurate background checks and excellent customer service while following strict compliance and data security protocols.


 


### How Does UltraCamp Handle Sensitive information?


UltraCamp is a secure website and requires a password or account to access. We also do not store your information like Social Security Number where anyone, not even you, can see it. In fact, once you enter the data and hit submit, the data immediately becomes encrypted on our server where no one can access it. Even if you, the user, reloads the page where you entered it previously, it does not show and can not be read.  
  
Since the background check process is integrated directly in to UltraCamp, there is never a time where you have to leave your information in an email or enter it into a third-party site.


 

# How to Schedule Sessions Again
## Updating Templates and Sessions


A common question asked is "How do I do what I did last year?" When you set up your program a second time, you'll still need to add sessions. However, you can leverage the templates and information you've entered previously to speed and smooth your process.


* Depending on your setup and how much has changed since last season, you'll probably want to update your templates before you schedule your sessions.
* Once your sessions are scheduled and tweaked for the upcoming season, you may also need to address additional settings.



#### 
 Tip


Make sure you have your new schedule, fees, discounts, activities, options, and documents on hand before you begin.



 


## Update Your Templates


When adding sessions for a new season, consider what items need to change, most commonly this will be **dates and fees**. 


The following templates could need adjustment:


* **Session-based fees**
	+ If your Fees are session-based, changing the **Cost** on the Fees page of the Session Template can save work if your pricing is standard for the new season.
	+ Update template: **Session Template**
* **Option fees**
	+ The Cost in the Fees section of an option template has had a price change. This is particularly important if your pricing is derived from Session Options.
	+ Update Template: **Option** **Template**
* **Discount amounts or codes**
	+ If your discount amounts or codes need to change for the current season, update the Simple and/or Multi-week discount templates accordingly.
	+ Update Templates: **Simple Discount** **Template**and/or **Multi-week Discount Template**
* **Message or date change in Confirmation Master**
	+ If you are using a confirmation master, you may want to update your message, particularly if it contains any date specifics.
	+ Update Template**: Confirmation Master**
* **New language, questions or dates**
	+ If you have new language, questions, or dates that need changing, you can update your Forms using the Layout page in the My Forms wizard.
	+ Update Template**: Forms**
* **PDF files**
	+ PDF files that have been added to UltraCamp's documents library may need to have new versions uploaded. This can be done by editing the existing Document and selecting a new File to upload over the old one.
	+ Update Template: **Document**


 


## **Schedule New Sessions**


Each new event will have to be scheduled with its unique dates. This can be done from the **Home page** or the **My Sessions menu** and will pull in your template data, but you may need to make further adjustments. 


You can do this in one of two ways:


* **Session Editing Wizard** - You can continue working in the Session Editing Wizard and use this to adjust most session-related settings.
* **Copy Settings from Session to Session** - If your new session shares features with a previously scheduled session, you can use the Copy Settings wizard to copy those shared features to the new session. The Copy Settings wizard can copy fees, activities, options, discounts, custom questions, and more.


**To copy Session Settings:** 


1. 1. Go to **Tools**
	2. Expand **Additional Tools**
	3. Select **Copy Session Settings**


 


## Additional Session Settings



#### 
 Note


These can not be set in the Session Editing Wizard.



* **Seasonal Fees** must be added via the Seasonal Fees link in the Finances section of the Scheduling menu.
* **New Session Custom Questions** must be added by clicking the link in the Custom Questions section of the Scheduling menu.
# Session Roster Report
The Session Roster is a versatile report for looking at registrations either as individuals or as a summary on a seasonal basis.    


**To access, go to:**


1. 1. Reports menu
	2. Rosters
	3. [Session Roster](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Reports/SessionRoster.aspx)


## 


## Report Parameters


The Session Roster is arranged so that near the top you select your filters, then your return information, and finally any display/printing parameters for your report. While you won't find headings breaking the Session Roster up into subsections, this help guide will use headings for ease of reference.


## 


## Filters


* **Select Season** use the dropdown menu to filter for the desired Season. You can use this filter to look to past, present, or upcoming sessions.
* **Select Location:** If your organization uses locations, you can filter for a specific location using the Select Location dropdown menu.
* **Session Categories or Session Subcategories:** If your organization uses Session Categories or Session Subcategories, you can use appropriate dropdown menu to narrow your search if so desired.
* **Session Begin Date***(optional)***:** Filtering by Session Begin Date is also an option using the calendar picker and one or more of the fields to the right.
* **Filter Sessions***(optional)***:** UltraCamp displays any sessions that fit the criteria indicated in the above filters. Checking the box for a session narrows the report search to just that session (or sessions). Otherwise, the report will search for all sessions listed.
* **Order Date***(optional)***:** Use the Order Date fields with their calendar picker to filter for reservations made within a specific date range.
* **Age or Gender:** In addition to the above filters, you can further limit the individuals returned in the report to a specific Age range *(optional)* or Gender.
* **Made By:** Use the Made By dropdown menu to limit the report to reservations made by clients or by administrative staff.
* **Session Balance***(optional)***:**The Session Balance filter can restrict return information to reservations with a balance equal to, less than, greater than, or not equal to a specified amount. Do not enter a dollar sign in this field.
	+ - = represents "Equal to"
		- < represents "Less than"
		- > represents "Greater than"
		- < > represents "Not Equal To" or "Does Not Equal"
* **Confirmation Status:** If your organization has elected to manually confirm reservations, you can filter by Confirmation Status using the dropdown menu.
* **Arrived / Attended:**The Arrived / Attended dropdown filter is designed to permit residential programs to track the arrival of attendees and filter by their arrival status.
* **Check-In Status:**Used primarily by day programs to toggle an individual between being "Checked In" and "Not Checked In." If your organization is using this feature, you can filter your report using the dropdown menu to select the desired status.


## 


## Report Type


* **Session Roster:** By default, the Session Roster is designed to display a roster of individuals attending a select set of sessions. This will display a row per person per reservation. You can use the Report Type dropdown to change from an Individual Roster report and view the information differently.
* **Grouped Roster:** A Report Type of "Grouped Roster" will return a single row per reservation. However, in the case of Group or Family reservations, all attendees will be listed in a single field and row for the reservation, instead of having a row per individual.
* **Summary:** A summary-style Session Roster lists all open session names along with their Begin Date. Additionally, the average attendee age per session as well as totals for enrollment and sales will be listed for each session.


## 


## Return Information


* **Report Return Information:** In every Session Roster, the report's return information will include the Session Name as well as the name of the attendee plus a column for each field as indicated by a check mark in the Return Information section.
	+ Several of these fields are selected by default but you may check and uncheck boxes as desired to configure what data you view on the returned report.



#### 
 Note


The list of available fields to pull from in the Session Roster is extensive. However, this report is not capable of pulling data from within custom online forms. For reports that mix online form data with roster information, a **Custom Report** is required.



 


* **Group Report By:**Using the Group Report By dropdown menu, you can arrange the display of the return information.
	+ If you select one of the items from the list, UltraCamp will display each variation of that item with its own heading.
	+ By checking the box to the right of the dropdown, the item divisions can be set to Print to separate page.
* **Search:** Clicking the Search button will run the report.


## 


## The Roster


The returned report displays in a series of columns. 


* The report can be sorted alpha-numerically by column by clicking the column header.
* Clicking the column header again will reverse the order from ascending to descending.
* Re-ordering the columns in this manner will erase any grouping indicated by the Group Order By in the Report Parameters.


The returned report can be printed by clicking the **print icon** or exported by clicking the **export icon** and using the links in the upper right of the report.

# A/R Aging
Accounts Receivable Aging reports, or A/R Aging for short, is a useful report in finding what accounts are truly overdue in your system. While the Account Balances report can give you an overall look at the balances due for your entire database, it does not tell you if the balances are outstanding or due in the future. To access the A/R Aging report:


1. 1. Click on the Reports menu
	2. Go to the Financial section
	3. Click on [A/R Aging](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Reports/ARAging.aspx)


## 


## Report Parameters


By default the report will run for the current date, but you can use the As Of Date field to check aging for a particular date, such as the start of the year.


## 


## Report Output





#### 


#### Example Output of the A/R Aging Report


**Report Fields**


* Name: Displays the Primary Contact of the account. Clicking on the eye icon will allow you to Peek at Account to see basic information.
* Account Balance: Displays the full Account Balance for the account.
* Current: Displays balances that are due in the future.
* 1-30 days: Displays balances that are 1-30 days overdue.
* 31-60 days: Displays balances that are 31-60 days overdue.
* 61-90 days: Displays balances that are 61-90 days overdue.
* > 90 days: Displays balances that are over 90 days overdue.
* Total Overdue: Adds up the balances from the 1-30 days column through the >90 days column to give the total overdue for the account.


 



#### 
 Tip


The A/R Aging report only reports balances for items that have a due date. If you have transactions such as a Misc Debit that are creating the balance, it will not show up on this report!



 


## What determines overdue status?


Sessions and Retreat reservations both have a Paid-in-Full due date field that determines when they are considered overdue. If a Paid-in-Full due date is not set, it will default to the start date of the event.


 





*Example of the Paid-in-Full due date field in the Session Editing Wizard*


 


For non-session fees such as donations and account fees, the due date is the same as the date of the item.





*In this example, the due date of the donation would be 4/2/2021.*


## 


## Saving A/R Aging Report


 A/R Aging report data can be: 


* Saved to a **Stored Group**
* Exported
* Printed

# Setting Up Custom Transactions
While UltraCamp has the most common types of transactions already built in to the system, your organization may want to add additional transaction types. Custom Transactions allow you to create your own option which will be available to your admins for use on account finances.


The default transaction types are:





 


To add or edit Custom Transactions, take the following steps:


1. Go the Settings menu and expand the **Accounting** section
2. Click [Custom Transaction Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/customTransactionsList.aspx)
3. Click **Create a Custom Transaction Type** or the edit icon to the right of an existing type


 


## Custom Transaction Settings


To create a Custom Transaction, you'll need to enter the appropriate settings.


The **Transaction Name** will display to clients on their financial history and statements as well as in your reporting.


The **Debit / Credit** setting determines how this transaction will impact account finances.


You can set an **Allocation Account Code** for the transaction type, but this will drastically impact financial reporting and should be done with caution. The Allocation number you set here will override the application of your cash number to the items this transaction is paying for. *Only use this if you absolutely need to track your custom transaction separately*.  


By default, all transactions in UltraCamp count towards Cash, except for the built-in Misc Debit and Misc Credit transaction types. You can specify this transaction type as a **Non-cash Transaction** by checking the box.


Checking the **Enabled** box makes this custom transaction an active option for your admins.


* 
# Alternate Contacts
In case of an emergency, organizations reach out to the Primary Contact first. If the Primary (or Secondary Contact) cannot be reached, your organization can refer to an Alternate Contact.


* Alternate Contacts can be collected during registration or added outside registration by the Primary Contact or an administrative user.


 


## Setting Up and Customizing Alternate Contacts


Alternate Contacts are enabled in the [My Settings wizard](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/secondarycontact.aspx) (Settings menu > System / Management > My Settings). Once in the wizard, proceed to the **About My Clients** section where you can:


* Turn the Alternate Contacts feature on or off on the [Alternate Contacts page](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/secondarycontact.aspx)
* Customize what Alternate Contact information is required and what is requested on the [Alternate Contacts Setup](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/alternatecontactsetup.aspx) page


 


When Alternate Contacts are enabled in the My Settings wizard, a page can be added to your registration process. Depending on your setup, this can be arranged in one of two ways:


* Through the Registration Page Order page in the Session Editing wizard for your session
* Through the Page Order Template found in the Settings menu > Session Templates > [Page Order Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/pageOrderMastersList.aspx)


 


## FAQ about Alternate Contacts


**Can I change "Alternate Contacts" to "Emergency Contacts"?**


Yes. Although we have found parents are likely to re-enter the primary contact information instead of adding someone else under the heading "Emergency Contact," you can change it by going to the Public Side and using Customize this Page to change the language on the following pages:


* <https://www.ultracamp.com/publicAccounts/publicAccountDetail.aspx>
* <https://www.ultracamp.com/publicaccounts/addeditsecondarycontact.aspx>


 


**Can I create my own Alternate Contact form and use that instead?**


Yes. You can use UltraCamp's [Custom Online Forms](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7231482555284) to build a questionnaire that collects the information your preferred way. Just keep in mind that with UltraCamp's built-in feature for Alternate Contacts, integration with reporting and the [Check-in / Check-out Tool](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7258990281236) is smooth and easy. This won't necessarily be true with your custom form. Additionally, with our built-in feature, a primary contact can enter unlimited Alternate Contacts, but a Custom Online Form will be limited by how many data fields you create.


 


**Can I create a "Do Not Contact" list?**


Yes. You can use UltraCamp's [Custom Online Forms](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7231482555284) feature to collect information about individuals who should not be contacted on behalf of an account. *However, we recommend training your staff to only reach out to specified contacts.* This way you'll avoid having to check in multiple places for information as well as minimize data collection from your families.


 

# Option Categories
Before you can schedule options for a particular program, you will need to create the categories and templates for these options.


* An Option Category must be created before an Option Template can be set up.
* Option Categories organize your Option Templates and determine how these choices are offered to your clients.


  
Find Option Categories by following these steps:


1. 1. Go to Settings menu and expand the **Option Templates** section.
	2. Click on [Option Categories](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/SessionOptionCategoriesList.aspx).


 


## Create and Edit Option Categories


To create a new option category or edit an existing option category, take the following steps:


1. Click on the **Create a New Session Option Category** button or the **Edit** icon to the right of an existing category
2. Enter the appropriate Basic Information
	* The Category Name is required
	* Set the Page Display Type
3. Enter the appropriate Selection Settings
	* Set the Select Mode
	* [Optional] Enter Minimum and Maximum limits
	* [Optional] Check the boxes for any desired selection settings
4. [Optional] Set the Financial Settings for this Option Category
	* Select an Allocation Account from the dropdown
	* Set whether discounts can apply to this category
5. Click the Save Category button


 



 


## Option Category Terms and Settings


Below is a detailed explanation of each of the settings for Option Categories:


### Basic Information


Only the Category Name is required. You may enter any of the optional information as desired.


#### Category Name


* The Category Name will serve as a header for reporting as well as display regarding any option within this category.


#### Category Description


* Here you can enter instructional or descriptive text for clients to help guide clients through option selection. Additional text will be automatically generated based on your Selection Settings.


#### Page Display Type


* Your **Page Display Type** determines how the options in this category will appear to during registration.
* Categories that are set to **Share page with other categories** will display with other categories sharing this setting.
* A Category set to **Display on its own page** will have its own dedicated page during registration.
* Selecting the display option to **Collect multiple session selections on a single page** will group all options that share this category setting on one page at the end of the registration process.



#### 
 Tip


By collecting multiple session selections on a single page, you can display all options from multiple sessions just prior to checkout. In order for this to work, however, the "Session Options" page must be removed from the Session Page Order (either on the individual session or the Page Order Template).



#### 


#### Rank


* Use the category **Rank** to override UltraCamp's default, which is to display categories in alpha-numeric order.
* Option categories with a lower rank will be displayed first and alpha-numerically within the same rank.


#### $0 Options on Printouts


* By default, this box is checked, and therefore all options will print on the Confirmation Receipt and other customer-oriented places where options are set to print.
* Uncheck the box to prevent options with no fees from showing on customer printouts.
* This setting does not affect the display of any options in the registration process or shopping cart.


 


### Selection Settings


When your clients register, the Selection Settings control what choices those clients can make from the options in this category. Administrators have the ability to override these limitations.


#### Select Mode


* The **Select Mode**determines the number of options a client can can choose
* Your choice here will generate automatic instructional text at the bottom of your Description text.
	+ If **Multiple Selections in category** are allowed, you will be able to set a **Minimum Number and/or a Maximum Number of Selections**.
	+ If Multiple Selections in category are allowed, you can also enable a **Select All** checkbox for this category.
* Check the box if **a selection from this category is required**.
	+ Enabling this option will generate automatic instructional text at the bottom of your Description text.
* You can **prevent reductions** by the public to the total number of selected options in this category when modifying reservations by checking the appropriate box.
	+ This will allow clients to change which options they selected but not reduce the number of options they’ve selected.


 


### Financial Settings


Financial settings on this Category will affect all options assigned to it:


#### Allocation Account


* By default, any money collected for fees in this category will go to the same financial tracking account as the session they are assigned to.
* If you wish to track the fees for this category of options separately from other fees, choose the desired **Allocation Account**from the dropdown menu.


#### Discounts can apply to options in this category


* By default, the box is checked to allow discounts to apply to option fees in this category.
* If you wish discounts to *not* apply to fees for options in this category, uncheck the box.
	+ Percentage-based discounts are the most profoundly affected by unchecking this box, since option fees from this category will not count in the percentage calculation.
	+ Dollar amount discounts will only be affected if the discount total is greater than the combined fees outside this category.


  
  



  
  


# Custom Online Form - Basic Settings
## Custom Online Forms


Custom Online Forms are used to gather information about your clients. Custom Online Form data is attached to individuals or accounts. You can [add Custom Online Forms to the registration process](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/10556700559380) or link people to the forms directly. You can even have a third party fill out data on a form and have that information attach to an individual or account. 


When creating a custom online form, you will use the My Forms wizard to:


* Determine form behavior on the Basic Settings page.
* Specify how a form is marked Complete.
* [Optional] Set up form-specific automated email notifications.
* Add text and questions to communicate and collect information.


  
  



## My Forms Wizard


The My Forms wizard primarily uses 4 pages to set up your form. Each page is detailed below. Expand the "Details" section to review the more advanced setup options on that page.


To access the My Forms Wizard:


* Go to **Settings**
* Expand **Systems/Management**
* Click on **My Forms**


  
  



## Basic Information


On the Basic Information page, you must address the following settings:


* **Specify the Form Name:** This will be used to identify the form to your clients as well as in your reporting.
* **Choose if the form will be For Individual or Account:**Your selection determines if the form data will be attached to individual people or to the account in general.
* **The Form Type defaults to Standard:** Completed by the Account Holder, but you can change this to Third Party Reference Form for situations where you want the information to be filled out by someone outside the account (like for a staff application reference).


  
  



## Basic Information Page Details


#### **Basic Information**


* **Form name:** Enter the name you wish to identify the form by
* **Category:**Categories are used to group forms. Enter text to create a new category or select one from the dropdown menu to use an existing category.
* **Form Description:** Descriptive text entered here will only ever appear beneath the Form Name in the Document Center on the public side.
* **For Individual or Account:** Use the dropdown to select whether the data for the form attaches to an *Individual* or the entire *Account*. Selecting Account will cause the form to display under the Primary Contact, as well as on the Account Detail page.
* **Contains Medical Information:** Checking this box will restrict access to those with the appropriate Medical user access.
* **Form Type:***Standard - Completed by account holder*is the default and used for most forms.
	+ Selecting Third Party Invite will change the behavior of the form.
	+ Instead of the account holder filling out the form directly, they will instead complete an "Invite" page which includes the email address of the Third Party.
	+ When the invite is completed, the form will be sent to the specified email address or "Third Party" who can then fill out the form. The form is then saved on the original individual's account.
	+ The Third Party does NOT need to have an account in UltraCamp to fill out the details.


#### **Visibility**


* **Allow the public to access this form outside the registration process:**
	+ This lets a person see, review, and edit the form after they first access it.
* **Allow the public to access this form from the document center:**
	+ This lets a person see, review, and edit a form directly without encountering it first via a link or registration.
* **Completed third-party forms are private and should not be visible to the public:**
	+ This only shows for Form Type: Third Party Invite.
	+ Checking this box will keep the Third Party's answer hidden from the account holder.


  
  



#### **Restrictions**


* **Age Restrictions**can be set for the form if it is set to attach to an Individual.
	+ UltraCamp will check the Individual's age at the time the form would be filled out to see if they should be given access.
	+ Individuals who are not currently within the set Age or Grade limits will not see the form.
* **Allow an "On File" option:** lets an admin designate that they have a hard copy of the data for reporting purposes. This does not put any data into UltraCamp.


#### **Expiration Settings**


The expiration settings determine how long UltraCamp considers form data to be up to date. 


* Set the **Expiration Type**to one of the following:
	+ **Each Season:**(the default) marks form data out of date at the end of the season in which they complete the form.
	+ **Never Expires:** means UltraCamp never marks form data as out of date.
	+ **Always New:**means UltraCamp never marks form data as out of date but saves each completion or edit of the form as a new dataset.
	+ **After X Days:**allows your organization to specify a specific number of days before UltraCamp marks form data as out of date.
* An **Expiration Grace Period** can be used to extend the time a form is considered up to date in UltraCamp.
* Setting the form to **Display only once per season** will prevent the form from showing up in subsequent registrations during the same season. It can still be accessed from the Document Center.


#### **Due Date Settings**


* Due date settings can put an alert on an account for Required Forms as designated on a session.


 


## Completion Acknowledgment


Use the Completion Acknowledgement page to specify how a form is identified as finished or up to date. You must address these settings for your form to function properly.


* For the **Completion Acknowledgement Type**, your choice will determine if a client can skip required fields and save their progress (*Ask if the form is complete*) or has to fill out all required fields before saving their progress (the other two options).
* **Signature Collection** can generate a certificate of authenticity by taking the clients chosen signature, IP address and time stamp if you choose Electronic Signature.


## Completion Acknowledgment Page Details


For the **Completion Acknowledgment Type**, choose:


* *Do not ask if the form is complete* if you just want a "Next" button to appear at the bottom of the page. Clients must fill out all required fields in order to proceed to the next page in the registration process.
* *Ask if the form is complete* to permit clients to say the form is complete if they have filled out all required fields or that they'll finish it later (and skip any required fields). If they choose to fill the form out later, they will be able to continue with the registration process. You can customize the text for both options in the text fields provided.
* *Require clients to attest that the form is complete* forces clients to fill out required fields and acknowledge that they are finished before proceeding to the next page. You can customize the acknowledgment text in the field provided.


For **Signature Collection** choose one:


* *None* -- No signature will be required.
* *Collect Electronic Signature* - This will require clients to agree to and choose an online signature. UltraCamp will then generate certificate of authenticity with their signature, time-stamp, and IP address. A copy of this certificate will be saved on the account as a pdf which preserves the form and answers as they were at the time of signature.
* *Hard Copy* - This will email the client a copy of their answers for them to print out and sign. They can then return this signed copy to your organization.


 


## Notifications


This page should really only be used in situation where the form is not part of a registration process or if you need someone to review each form as it is submitted.


You can designate notifications To Clients on this page when they first complete the form and/or when they update it. You can also designate notifications To Staff for the same.


  
  



## Notifications Page Details


#### **To Clients**


This section sets up notifications that go to the account holder for the form. Custom messaging can be added to these notifications.


* The box to **Send email confirmation to clients upon completion** will trigger an email to the Primary Contact the first time a form is completed.
* The box to **Send email confirmation to clients upon update** will trigger an email to the Primary Contact any time they update or mark the form as complete.


#### 


#### **To Staff**


This section sets up notifications to send to a designated admin user.


* The dropdown menu for **Send notifications when updates are made to a completed forms** will trigger an email to the selected staff member whenever a client modifies a form that was previously marked Complete.
* The dropdown menu for **Send notifications when updates are made to all forms** will trigger an email to the selected staff member any time the form is updated and its data is saved.


 


## Layout


The **Layout**page is where you add text and questions to communicate and collect data. Once added, text and questions can be re-ordered by dragging the desired block up or down the page. Click the **Complete**button to save changes on the Layout page to your database.

* All responses to Custom Question Templates are stored in a specific table in the database. If a question is removed from a form, all data related to that question is wiped from the table and lost.
* UltraCamp only saves the most recent response to a question on a form, writing over previous answers unless the form Expiration is set to "Always New." In this case, custom reports only return the most recent response data.
* Changing the question prompt does not affect stored answers on a Custom Question.

* + Connecticut

# Send a Group Email 
## Mass Email


A single email can be sent to a designated group of individuals through UltraCamp. This email can be personalized to each recipient if desired and contain attachments as well as links. Marketing emails can be designated as such and automatically attach an unsubscribe link which will prevent those who click the link from receiving further marketing emails without adversely affecting normal fee and reservation communication.    


1. Go to the **Tools** menu and expand **Correspondence** menu.
2. Click the link to **[Email a Stored Group.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Correspondence/email.aspx)**
3. On the resulting page, choose the "Email a stored group" option to proceed.



  
  



## Select a Stored Group


1. 1. Click on the dropdown menu.
	2. Select the stored group to whom you would like to send an email.
		* To enable emailing of a stored group, it must contain one of the following columns: idAccount, idPerson, or email.
	3. Click the Next button to proceed.


 



#### 
 Tip


Stored Groups are created using reports. To learn more about creating stored groups, you can use one of the related topics links at the bottom of this page or click here.



 


## Advanced Tool Checkbox


By default, the Send and Email tool will walk you through several pages of settings in order to generate your email. Use the Next button to proceed from page to page.


To the right of the subsequent page is a checkbox that says Use **advanced email tool**. Checking this box will display all the sections of the email tool in a single scrolling page.





 


## Send Information


* **Subject field:** Enter the subject line for the email. This is a required field.
* **From field:**Using the From field, you may select any email address from your list of users or the general camp email address as the email of origin.
* **CC field:** If an email address is entered in the CC field, that email address will receive a copy of the email as well. By default, will CC only the first email in the group and not send a copy of every email in the stored group. However, you can override this by unchecking the appropriate box.



#### 
 Tip


You can enter multiple addresses in the CC line if you separate them with a comma.



 


* **To:**The stored group you selected will be displayed in the To: line. You can also indicate whether you wish the email should be sent to the Primary Contact , the Individual identified in the stored group by idPerson (often the attendee), or Both if they are identified with different email addresses on the account.
	+ **Inactive Accounts** are not sent mass emails by default. However, you can override this setting by unchecking the designated box.


## 
When should the email be sent?


* **Send Date:** This determines when a queued email will actually begin to transmit. If this field is left blank, the queued email will begin to transmit 15 minutes from when you press the Send button. You can set the Send Date to any other time using the calendar and time pickers.
* **Emergency:**An email can be designated as an emergency email by checking the Emergency box. This bypasses other email processes and queues the message for immediate delivery. This option should only be used for emergency situations.


If you are not using the advanced email tool, click the **Next**button to proceed.


## 
Is this a Marketing Email?


Federal law requires that all emails sent for the purpose of marketing include an opt out provision. On all mass emails, you must indicate whether or not this is a marketing email.



#### 
 Tip


What counts as a marketing email? Any correspondence concerning an upcoming, existing reservation or information regarding account balances is NOT considered marketing. Everything else is probably marketing.



* **Marketing Allotment:** If you are using UltraCamp's email servers to send on your behalf, you'll receive a free monthly allotment of marketing emails. Going over this allotment will result in a charge per recipient as indicated in your contract. UltraCamp displays the remaining marketing emails for the month next to the **Yes, this is a marketing email**answer option.
* **Regular email:** If you are using an email sending scheme, UltraCamp will be mailing directly from your email server and no fees will be assessed from UltraCamp. Please contact your provider for information on email limits and fees.


If you are not using the advanced email tool, click the **Next**button to proceed.


## 
Email Templates


* **Save as New Template:** Email messages can be saved as templates for repeated use using the Save as a new template link. This will bring up a popup window where you can name the template and indicate whether you wish to save its attachments as well. Use the Save Template button to store your template in the database.
* **Load an Email Template:**Once a template has been saved it can be edited by selecting it from the Load an Email Template dropdown menu. You can change the content of the template and use the Save link to save your changes. Use the Delete link to remove the template from the database permanently.

Email Content


The creation of the email message takes place in the **Email Content** section. At the top of this section are Formatting Tools which can be used to help compose your message or even paste it in from an external source. The function of each button can be seen by holding your mouse over it. Below the buttons is a row of dropdown menus for indicating Font Name and Size.


* **Links to UltraCamp:** In addition to these formatting options, you can also add Links to UltraCamp to the email. To do this, place your cursor in the composition area below where you want the link to show then select the desired link from the dropdown menu.
* **Personalization Fields:** These can be used to tailor the message to individual recipient. Selecting a field from the dropdown menu will place code at your cursor in the composition area. When the email is queued, UltraCamp will replace this code with information from the account or stored group. For example, selecting the personalization "primary\_nameFirst" would insert the first name of the primary contact into the recipient's email.
* **Insert Content Here:** The message itself is written over the text "Insert content here" below your logo and contact information.
* **Display of Message:** At the bottom of the composition area, you can adjust the display of the message from the Design view (the default view) to the HTML view where you can interact with the html directly or to a Preview mode which hides the design markings and isn't editable but offers a look at the email appearance.


## 
Attachments


Files can be attached to the email from the library of **Documents** uploaded via the Settings menu, financial Statements, or you can select a file from your computer using the **Choose File** button.


## 
Previewing and Sending


You can use the **Preview** button to have UltraCamp generate the email for review. This will also display a summary section where you can edit some of the basic message settings if necessary. Click the View link to look at the email itself.


* **Send Email:** Click the Send Email button to queue mass email for delivery.



#### 
 Tip


Once you've queued the email, you may review it using the **Account Correspondence icon** in the Current Account menu or by using the Email Correspondence report in the Reports menu. If the email is still in the queue, it can even be deleted to prevent it from sending.



 


## Checking Status of Mass Email in Queue

* + The deposit **Name** will show both to admins who are adding the deposit to a retreat reservation and to the public when they review their reservation communication.
	+ Choose with **Deposit Type** you'd like to apply to this template. This will determine what happens to the deposit if a retreat reservation is cancelled:
		- A **Non-refundable** deposit will continue to apply as a fee on a client's balance after event cancellation.
		- A deposit that is set to be **100% Refundable** will not apply to a client's balance if their reservation is cancelled.
		- A deposit that is set to be a **Custom Percent Refundable** will require that you enter that percent so UltraCamp can calculate how much of the deposit will be kept as a fee upon cancellation.
	+ The **Deposit Amount** is the default value of your deposit. This can be manually adjusted by an admin when it is added to a retreat reservation.
	+ Choose either Percentage or Dollar for the Deposit Amount Type to tell UltraCamp how to calculate the Deposit Amount.
	+ If you wish the Deposit Amount to be its own additional fee on top of all other reservation fees, check the box to **Add deposit amount to reservation balance**. Only use this checkbox if you do *not* wish payments toward the deposit to count toward other fees on the reservation.
	+ You may choose an **Allocation Account** for monies assigned to the deposit. This will allow for separate financial tracking for retreat deposits using this template, but this is optional.

# ACH Processing in UltraCamp
UltraCamp operates as an ACH Originator and can facilitate electronic payments and refunds for your customers. The ACH system allows you to transfer money between bank accounts, rather than going through the payment card networks (Visa/Mastercard, Discover, or American Express). UltraCamp operates under the rules of NACHA (National Automated Clearing House Association), which is the administrator and governor of the ACH Network.


## How Payments are Made by your Customers


Customers can add bank account information to their account from the payment page. The page requires the Account Type, Name on Account, Bank Routing Number, and Bank Account Number. It also includes an Authorization for your organization and “UltraCamp LLC” to electronically debit their account for fees incurred. This authorization is encrypted and stored in UltraCamp and will remain in effect until such authorization is revoked by the account holder. The maximum per-transaction dollar limit is $1,000,000.


ACH transactions are not real-time but are batched every morning for the previous day’s entries. ACH entries are irrevocable once they have been sent for processing and can only be voided in the short time period before they are batched.


## Prenotes for Account Validation


Any time a customer adds a new unique bank account to their account, it triggers the creation of a Prenote. A Prenote is a zero-dollar entry that is used to verify the bank account information of your customer. By NACHA rule, there is a 3-day waiting period after submitting a Prenote before a live transaction can be sent.


## Settlement Process


Customer payments take 3-4 business days to settle into the UltraCamp ParentPay holding account. Once we receive the batch, we create a new batch to send the funds to your designated bank account. This process takes an additional 3-4 business days to settle.


Customer refunds take the same amount of time and go from your account to the UltraCamp ParentPay account then to the customer account.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ACH Process | Days |
| Prenote | 3 |
| Parent to UltraCamp ParentPay | 3 to 4 |
| UltraCamp ParentPay to Camp | 3 to 4 |
| Possible Processing Time | 6 to 11 business days |


 


## ACH Returns


ACH transactions can be returned for several reasons:


* Insufficient funds
* Bank account closed
* No bank account/unable to locate account
* Invalid bank account number
* Payment stopped


Returns will automatically create a “Returned ACH” transaction in the customer financial detail reversing the payment attempted. UltraCamp can also add a “Returned ACH Fee” with a penalty amount based on the type of return. You will be charged the ACH Return Fee regardless of the type of return.


## ACH Processing Fees




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

# Gender Collection
UltraCamp can collect Gender information about individuals. In addition to reporting, gender is used to determine capacity and eligibility for sessions, lodging, activities, and waiting lists.


Gender Expressions allow your organization to customize how individuals identify themselves. Because of the integral way gender figures into lodging and capacity, these Gender Expressions do tie back to one of the binary genders for lodging and capacity purposes. However, these binary identifiers are only visible on the administrative side of UltraCamp--Gender Expressions are what clients will see throughout their interactions with their account.


Capacity is based on a binary gender, Male and Female, which can be used to limit availability based on your staff and facility needs.


 


## How to Customize Gender Collection:


1. 1. To add or edit Gender Expressions, go to the **[Settings menu](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/GenderExpressionsList.aspx)**
	2. Expand [**System / Management**](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/GenderExpressionsList.aspx)  and select [**Gender Expressions**](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/GenderExpressionsList.aspx)**.**


 


Here you can modify or create new Gender Expressions.


* The **Name** is what clients will see in their accounts when they identify their gender.
* The **Short Name** will appear as an abbreviation (primarily in reporting)
* The **Binary Gender Mapping** ties the Expression to the capacities in UltraCamp--session, activity, and lodging
* The **Binary Gender Action when Selected** identifies UltraCamp's reaction to selecting this Gender Expression
* UltraCamp will display Gender Expressions in alpha-numeric order unless you override this with a **Sort Order**.

# FAQ: Why aren't my options showing in registration?
There are several common reasons why your options might not be showing in the registration process. Here are the most common culprits and how to identify and fix them:


 


## Reason #1: Options Aren't Scheduled


Options must be scheduled in order to show in registration. Here's how you can identify if your options are scheduled and how to add them if they are not.


**To see if your options are not scheduled, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Open the **Session Editing wizard** for the session you are testing.
	2. Proceed to the **Session Options** page in the Additional Information section.


If your options are scheduled, you should see them listed on the page. *If they aren't showing here, you will need to schedule them.*


 


#### Solution:


**Here is how to schedule missing options:**


1. 1. Open the **Session Editing wizard** for the session that is missing options.
	2. Proceed to the **Session Options** page in the Additional Information section.
	3. On the Session Options page, click **Add Options**.
	4. In the popup window, locate your missing options in the list and check their box.
	5. Click the **Add Options** button at the bottom of the popup window.


Your options should now show in the registration process.


 



#### 
 Tip


You can add a single option to multiple sessions at once using our [Schedule Options](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7228701523988-Scheduling-Session-Options#adding-a-single-option-0-2) feature.



 


## Reason #2: Options are Full


If your options have reached capacity, they may be hidden from public view. Each option has a setting that says "Display to public when unavailable" on the Option Template. If this box is not checked, an option that reaches capacity will be hidden from view in public registration.


**Here's how to check if your options are full:**


1. 1. Go to the **Reports menu** and expand the **Rosters** section.
	2. Click [Session Options Roster](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Reports/sessionOptionsReport.aspx)
	3. [Optional] Check the box for the missing option and/ or the session you are investigating.
	4. In the **Report Type** dropdown menu, select **Summary**.
	5. Click the **Search** button.


Your options will be listed along with the your current capacity and enrollment. You should be able to identify any options that are full using this report.


If your options are full, you can increase the capacity or change the visibility for full options.


 


#### Solutions:


**To increase your capacity for an option, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Open the **Session Editing wizard** for your session.
	2. Proceed to the **Session Options** page in the Additional Information section.
	3. Click on the name of the Option you wish to adjust.
	4. In the popup window, enter the new **Availability Limit**.
	5. Click the **Save Option** button.


Your capacity / availability limit for this option has now been updated. You can also [Bulk Update Scheduled Session Options](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/bulkUpdates/bulkUpdate_options.aspx) to perform this change across multiple sessions or options all at once.


 


**To change the visibility for full options, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the **Option Templates** section.
	2. Click [Option Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/SessionOptionTemplates.aspx).
	3. Locate your option template and click on it.
	4. In the "Display Information" section, check the box to **Display to public when unavailable**.
	5. Click the **Save Option Master** button at the bottom.


Your option will now continue to be visible when full, but it will be marked as full and will not be select-able for public registration. This is a fixed setting and will therefore affect all options scheduled from this template. You can use the [Bulk Update Option Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/bulkUpdates/bulkUpdate_optionMasters.aspx) to perform this change across multiple templates at once.


 


## Reason #3: Options Aren't Visible to Public


Option templates can be set to be visible to the public, visible to admins, or both. If these settings are not enabled, options will not be displayed to the designated user.


Here is how to check the visibility settings of an option:


1. 1. Open the **Session Editing wizard** for the session you are testing.
	2. Proceed to the **Session Options** page in the Additional Information section.
	3. Click the name of the Option you wish to check.


In the pop-up window, you will find the checkboxes for "Visible to Public" and "Visible to Admin." If the box is checked, this option will be visible to the designated user group.


 


#### Solution:


**To change the visibility settings for options, take the following steps:**


1. 1. Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the **Option Templates** section.
	2. Click [Option Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/SessionOptionTemplates.aspx).
	3. Locate your option template and click on it.
	4. In the "Display Information" section, check the box to make the option **Visible to Public**.
	5. [Optional but recommended] In the "Display Information" section, check the box to make the option **Visible to Admin**.
	6. Click the **Save Option Master** button at the bottom.


Your option will now show in the registration process.


 



#### 
 Tip


Option Visibility settings can be adjusted through the [Bulk Updates](https://help.ultracamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/7228698449428) tool. Since Visible to Public and Visible to Admin are flexible settings, you will want to use the tool to [Bulk Update Scheduled Options](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/bulkUpdates/bulkUpdate_options.aspx).



 


## Reason #4: The Options Page Isn't in the Registration Process


Some options may not show in registration based on their **Option Category** settings and **Registration Page Order** settings. Evaluating these settings can be a multi-step process so follow these steps carefully:


 


#### Step 1: Determine Option Category Settings


Option Category settings determine if Options need to be added to the Registration Page Order. The key Option Category setting is **Page Display Type**.


Here is how to check the Option Category Settings:


* + Go to the **Settings** menu and expand the **Option Templates** section.
	+ Click [Option Categories](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/SessionOptionCategoriesList.aspx).
	+ Locate the category for the desired options and click the edit icon to the right.
	+ The dropdown menu for **Page Display Type** shows the selected settings.


Option Categories have three possible types of display:


* + Share page with other categories
	+ Display on its own page
	+ Collect multiple session selections on a single page


*If an Option Category is set to **Share page with other categories** or to **Display on its own page**, options must be included in the Registration Page Order.*


If the option category is set to "Collect multiple session selections on a single page," the options will always show at the end of registration regardless of page order settings.


 


#### Step 2: Determine Page Order Settings


Page Order can be set in two places:


* + On the individual Session
	+ On a Page Order Template attached to the Session Template


The simplest way to determine which Page Order approach is being used is to take the following steps:


* + Open the **Session Editing wizard** for the desired session.
	+ Go to the **Registration Page Order** page in the **Basic Setting** section.
	+ If the page displays two columns of blocks in different colors, the Page Order is controlled on this page in the session.
	+ If the page says "The session master for this session is using the page order template..." you are using a Page Order Template.


 


#### Step 3: Ensure the Options page is in the Registration Page Order


Once you've determined how the Page Order is controlled, you can ensure the Options page is included in the Registration Page Order.


**If your Page Order is set in the Session, use the following steps:**


* Open the **Session Editing wizard** for the desired session.
* Go to the **Registration Page Order** page in the **Basic Setting** section.
* If the Options is not listed in the right-hand column, click and drag it into the Registration Page Order.
* Click the Complete button to save your changes.


This session is now updated. You may have to repeat these steps for other sessions or use the Copy Session Settings wizard to copy this Page Order to other sessions.


 


**If your Page Order is set on a Page Order Template, use the following steps:**


* Open the **Session Editing wizard** for the desired session.
* Go to the **Registration Page Order** page in the **Basic Setting** section.
* Click the link in the text "To make changes to the page order template, click here."
* If the Options is not listed in the right-hand column, click and drag it into the Registration Page Order.
* Click the **Save Option Template** button.


All sessions that use this Page Order Template will now be updated to these settings.

# Custom Online Forms & Reports

### FAQ




**If the box is unchecked for client visibility can they still see just not alter after completed (within forms in their account)**

If the parents or clients can see the form they are able to edit the form. The only way to prevent edits is to uncheck both boxes in the visibility section.





**If we selected “never expires” in the expiration settings, is there a way to require attendees to look at that version and verify that it is still accurate or make modifications as needed?**
The form expirations do not control whether or not a form is displayed in the reservaiton process. If the form is in the registration process, it will display based on the forms settings (display only once per season). The exiprations are useful to help know if a form has been updated or completed in the timeframe indicated.


**If the form is needed to fill out every 3 years, would we select the After X Days and jstu put that many days?**
The expiration does not control when a form is displayed in the registraiton process. It is for reporting purposes. With X days, you can report on whether or not a form has been completed in the last X days. If the form is in the registration process parents will see the form and be able to update information.
