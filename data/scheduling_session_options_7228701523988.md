# Scheduling Session Options
## Overview


In order to select options as part of a reservation, the option templates must be connected to the desired session by scheduling them.  


When you wish to add a single option template to multiple sessions at once, the easiest way to accomplish this is through Session Options in the Scheduling menu. This same tool can be used to remove a session option as well.
