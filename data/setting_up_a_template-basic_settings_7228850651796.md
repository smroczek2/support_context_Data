# Setting Up a Template - Basic Settings
In the Session Template Wizard, start with the Basic Settings page. This contains the minimum data required to create a template. Once this page is completed, a template will be saved.


 


## To set up in the Session Template Wizard:


1. 1. Go to **Settings menu.**
	2. Expand **Session Templates section.**
	3. Click on **Session Templates.**
	4. Create a **New Session Template** or edit an existing template using the **edit icon** to the right of the desired template.



#### 
 Note


If you previously clicked "Do not display this page to me again", you will not see that page.



 



 


## Session Name


* Every session template must have a name.
* The Session Name is a flexible setting.
* It functions as a default when scheduling a session which can be adjusted during the Scheduling Process.


 


## Registration Type


* This determines whether a single reservation accommodates one individual or multiple attendees.



#### 
 Note


Registration type is a fixed setting and may not be changed once sessions are scheduled from this template.



* **Individual-based templates** are the most common. Under this scenario a separate reservation is made for each attendee. Individual-based sessions offer the most flexibility in collecting information for and about an individual.
* **Group-based** are for sessions that enroll multiple people within a single reservation. Common examples would be a "Family Camp" or a "Mother / Daughter Weekend."


 


## Session Category


* Session Categories are used to group scheduled events under a particular heading. This can be very helpful to your clients, making your sessions visually organized and easy to view.
	+ This is a fixed setting
	+ All events scheduled from this Session Template will share the same category.
	+ This is an optional field.


* To create a Session Category:
	+ Click on **Settings menu**
	+ Go to **Session Templates**
	+ Select **Session Categories**.


* **Sessions are grouped in the following order:**


1. 1. 1. Location
		2. Session Category
		3. Session Subcategory 1
		4. Session Subcategory 2


 



#### 
 Tip


Only Session Category is set in the Session Template. All others are determined during the Scheduling process.



 


## Session Description


* Session Description text can be entered on the Template.
* Descriptions will show to the public if they indicate they want to learn more detailed information about the session/event you are offering and on the Session Information page.
* Session Name, Dates, Age/Grade restrictions, and Cost are automatically displayed.
* Additional information such as discounts, activities, and options may also be displayed on the Session Information page.



#### 
 Tip


Your clients may access this page if they click on the **Session Name**in the **Summary of Sessions** or the **Info link**on the **Select Sessions page**.



## 


## Photo


* A Photo can be attached to the Session Template. This photo will display on the Session Information page or when clients click the Info while registering.
* This is an optional setting but it is also a fixed setting so the same photo will be used for all sessions scheduled from this Template.
* Use the **Complete button** to save your changes and proceed to the next page.
