## Custom Report Builder


When UltraCamp's Standard Reports don't provide the combination of individual data that you are looking for, you may use the Custom Report Builder to create your own reports. 


The Custom Report Builder creates spreadsheet-type reports that can pull data from all over UltraCamp and combine them in roster or summary reports. These reports can then be printed to pdf, exported to Excel or a csv file.


**To create use the Custom Report Builder:**


1. 1. Go to the Reports menu.
	2. Expand Custom Reports-Marketing.
	3. Click on [Create a Custom Report.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/reportbuilder/reportbuilder.aspx)
