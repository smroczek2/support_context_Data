# Completion Monitoring
Completion Monitoring allows an admin to track a client's progress through the registration process. Monitoring starts once a client selects a session. If they then do not complete the registration, an automated reminder email will be sent to them. This email contains a link back to that specific session along with an invitation to finish the process. Admins can view statistical information on both complete and incomplete registrations by running the Completion Monitoring report.
