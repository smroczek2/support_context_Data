## Report Parameters


You can filter the report in several ways to look for specific data. Filters can be used individually or in conjunction with others.


* **Medication Name:** Use the Medication Name field to look for individuals with a specific medication. The Dosage and Route fields can be used in the same way.
* **Schedule:** The Schedule filter is used by checking off the day (or days) and time(s) to which you wish to restrict the report. Leaving these boxes unchecked will cause the report to return all medications fitting any other filters.
* **Who Is Also In:** Another way to filter the Medications report is to look for any individual who Is also In a specific stored group. The dropdown menu will display any stored group that has idPerson in it. Select the desired stored group to limit the report to only individuals within that group.
* **Sessions:**The most common way to filter the Medications Roster is to simply check the box for one or more of the current year's Sessions. This will return individuals who are registered for that designated session and who have medication(s).
