# Authorized Pickup
An **Authorized Pickup** is someone who has permission to pick a child up from one of your programs. Each account has its own distinct set of authorized pickups. By default, this includes the Primary Contact, but it can include others as designated by the Primary Contact or an admin.


 


## Collecting Authorized Pickup Information


When authorized pickup is enabled in the My Settings wizard, you can add a page to your registration process to collect this information. Depending on your setup, this can be done in one of two ways:


* Through the Registration Page Order page in the Session Editing wizard for your session
* Through the Page Order Template found in the Settings menu > Session Templates > [Page Order Templates](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/Config/pageOrderMastersList.aspx)


Authorized pickup information can also be collected from the Account Detail page. This is done by expanding the **Pickup Authorizations** menu and clicking [Edit Authorizations.](https://www.ultracamp.com/admin/accounts/editAltPickup.aspx)


 


## Frequently Asked Questions


**Can I turn off Authorized Pickups in UltraCamp?**


Yes. Go to the My Settings wizard (Settings menu > System / Management > My Settings). Proceed to the [Authorized Pickups](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/altpickups.aspx) page in the "About My clients" section. Here you can turn Authorized Pickups off.


 


**Can I set up a Do Not Pickup List?**


We recommend training your staff to only release campers to people on the Authorized Pickup list. However, if you wish to add a "Do Not Pickup List," you can use a Custom Online Form.

Yes. Go to the My Settings wizard (Settings menu > System / Management > My Settings). Proceed to the [Authorized Pickups](https://www.ultracamp.com/Admin/Wizards/setup/altpickups.aspx) page in the "About My clients" section.
