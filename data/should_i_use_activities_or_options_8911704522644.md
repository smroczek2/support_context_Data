## When should I use Activities?


Use Activities when an individual should make one or more selections that correspond to a part of a day. Here are some examples of when activities work well:


* If an individual must choose a morning class and an afternoon class
* If an individual can sign up for a wait list if an activity is full but still must choose one with openings (in case space doesn't open up)
* If multiple sessions share the same class rosters and capacity limits


 


## When should I use Options?


Options are much more commonly used than activities. Use options when you have pricing that changes based on the number of selections made. Here are some examples of when Options are the best choice:


* For setting up a Day Camp where people can select individual days
* For group registrations where a family selects lodging for their reservation
* For optional add-ons to a reservation like extra care,
