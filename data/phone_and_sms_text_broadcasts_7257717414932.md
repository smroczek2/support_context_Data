UltraCamp will only send text and SMS messages to phone numbers that have checked the box agreeing to receive such messages. This is done at account creation but can be edited on and individual level later as well.



1. 4. Click the **Send**button to queue the broadcast


 


### **Why only 160 characters?**


SMS technology limits a message to 160 characters. Longer messages are broken into smaller chunks and then reassembled at the receiving end. However, this assembly process can be problematic, resulting in confusing messages so at this time if you wish to send longer messages, you'll need to compose and send them separately.
