# Tax Receipts For Donors 
When Tax time approaches, UltraCamp has several ways to send tax receipts to donors. You can choose to print receipts for mailing or email them to donors directly. For both methods, the process starts with creating a stored **Donation Report**.


##

**Option A: Reports Menu**


1. 1. Go to **Reports** expand **Financial**.
	2. Click on **Donations**.
	3. Select the season or calendar date range that you want to pull donations for.
	4. Scroll to bottom and click **Load Report**.
		* You should now be shown a results list that contains all of the donations made for the time frame you indicated in the report parameters.
	5. Save results as a **stored group**.


 **Option B: Extra Service Menu**


1. 1. Go to **Extra Services** and expand **Donor Management**.
	2. Select **Donation Reports**.
	3. Select the season or calendar date range that you want to pull donations for.
	4. Scroll to bottom and click **Load Report**.
	5. You should now be shown a results list that contains all of the donations made for the time frame you indicated in the report parameters.
